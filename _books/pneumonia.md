# Pharmacotherapy of Pneumonia:-

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames your lungs' air sacs (alveoli). The air sacs may fill up with fluid or pus, causing symptoms such as a cough, fever, chills and trouble breathing.

✨Symptoms of Pneumonia?

Pneumonia symptoms can vary from so mild you barely notice them, to so severe that hospitalization is required. How your body responds to pneumonia depends on the type germ causing the infection, your age and your overall health.

The signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:

▪️Cough, which may produce greenish, yellow or even bloody mucus

▪️Fever, sweating and shaking chills

▪️Shortness of breath

▪️Rapid, shallow breathing

▪️Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough

▪️Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue

▪️Nausea and vomiting, especially in small children

▪️Confusion, especially in older people

✨Bacterial pneumonia, which is the most common form, tends to be more serious than other types of pneumonia, with symptoms that require medical care. The symptoms of bacterial pneumonia can develop gradually or suddenly. Fever may rise as high as a dangerous 105 degrees F, with profuse sweating and rapidly increased breathing and pulse rate. Lips and nailbeds may have a bluish color due to lack of oxygen in the blood. A patient's mental state may be confused or delirious.

✨The symptoms of viral pneumonia usually develop over a period of several days. Early symptoms are similar to influenza symptoms: fever, a dry cough, headache, muscle pain, and weakness. Within a day or two, the symptoms typically get worse, with increasing cough, shortness of breath and muscle pain. There may be a high fever and there may be blueness of the lips.

✨Symptoms may vary in certain populations. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Or, they may vomit, have a fever and cough, or appear restless, sick, or tired and without energy. Older adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower than normal temperature. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness. For individuals that already have a chronic lung disease, those symptoms may worsen.

✨Note;

There are various types of pneumonia namely;

✓Viral
✓Bacterial
And
✓Fungal

✨Diagnostic Tests

recommended tests to confirm the diagnosis and confirm the present of pneumonia. may include:

▪️Blood tests to confirm the infection and to try to identify the germ that is causing your illness.

▪️Chest X-ray to look for the location and extent of inflammation in your lungs.

▪️Pulse oximetry to measure the oxygen level in your blood. Pneumonia can prevent your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.

▪️Sputum test on a sample of mucus (sputum) taken after a deep cough, to look for the source of the infection.

If you are considered a high-risk patient because of your age and overall health, or if you are hospitalized, the doctors may want to do some additional tests, including:

▪️CT scan of the chest to get a better view of the lungs and look for abscesses or other complications.

▪️Arterial blood gas test, to measure the amount of oxygen in a blood sample taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. This is more accurate than the simpler pulse oximetry.

▪️Pleural fluid culture, which removes a small amount of fluid from around tissues that surround the lung, to analyze and identify bacteria causing the pneumonia.

▪️Bronchoscopy, a procedure used to look into the lungs' airways. If you are hospitalized and your treatment is not working well, doctors may want to see whether something else is affecting your airways, such as a blockage. They may also take fluid samples or a biopsy of lung tissue.

✨Summarily:

What is pneumonia?
• Lung parenchyma/ alveolar (air‐filled sacs of the
lung responsible for absorbing oxygen from the
atmosphere) inflammation and (abnormal)  
alveolar filling with fluid.

✨Community acquired pneumonia
Definition:
Is an acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma that is associated with at least some symptoms
of acute infection, accompanied by the presence of an acute infiltrate on a chest radiograph, in a
patient not hospitalized or residing in a long term care facility for > 14 days before onset of symptoms.

CAP can be defined both on clinical and radiographic findings.
In the absence of chest radiograph, CAP is defined as:
(a) symptoms of an acute lower respiratory tract illness (cough with
or without expectoration, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain)
for less than 1 week; and
(b) at least one systemic feature (temperature >37.7°C, chills, and
rigors, and/or severe malaise); and
(c) new focal chest signs on examination (bronchial breath sounds
and/or crackles);

Pathogenesis
Inhalation
Aspiration
Hematogenous
Primary inhalation: when organisms bypass normal
respiratory defense mechanisms or when the Pt
inhales aerobic organisms that colonize the upper
respiratory tract or respiratory support equipment
Aspiration: occurs when the Pt aspirates colonized
upper respiratory tract secretions
Hematogenous: originate from a distant source and
reach the lungs via the blood stream.

✨Risk factors:
Viral infections (damage cilia and produce serous exudates)
Age (elderly‐ defect in swallowing, ↓ immunity)
Alcoholism (depress coughing and epiglottis function)
Smoking (damage epithelial cells and impair cilia functions
Asthma/COPD
Immunosuppression (AIDS, transplant pt, cancer chemo)
Dementia
Diabetes Mellitus‐ defective neutrophil function, ↓ CMI
Renal Failure‐ ↓ humural response, ↓ leukocyte chemotaxis, complement depletion
Chronic lung diseases
Cold Weather (dry mucous membrane and person to person spread)‐ common in winter
Heart Disease‐ Impaired lymphatics & alv macrophage function, edema promotes
bacterial growth.

Risk Factors in Patients Requiring Hospitalization
older, unemployed, unmarried
common cold in the previous year
asthma, COPD; steroid or bronchodilator use
Chronic disease
amount of smoking
alcohol NOT related to increased risk

✨Symptoms and Signs:

•Typical Pneumonia
Sudden/subacute onset
Fever with chills, rigors
Productive cough, Mucopurulent sputum
Tachypnea and tachycardia
Breathlessness
Pleuritic chest pain
Breath sound: crackles and rales
CXR: air‐bronchogram, consolidation
Clinical Presentation
–

•Atypical Pneumonia
Gradual onset – Afebrile
Dry cough
Breath sound: Rales
WBC: usual normal or slight high
Sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, diarrhea
Common etiology
Mycoplasma pneumonia
Chlamydia pneumoniae
Legionella pneumophilla
Mycobactria
Virus, Others.

✨DIAGNOSIS

•Routine blood investigations:-

-CBC with differential
-BUN/Cr, electrolytes Glucose,
liver enzymes.

•Blood culture

Microbiological tests;
-Sputum Gram stain
-Sputum for culture
-Sputum for Ziehl Neelsen stain
-Sputum cytology

Serological test:
-Pneumococcal antigen test
-Legionella antigen

✨TREATMENT
Why do we need to treat
Its potentially fatal
Eradicate the causative organism from the site and reverse the
inflammatory process
Prevent complications
Prevent mortality

✨Hospital acquired pneumonia
Definition:

HAP is an inflammatory condition of the lung parenchyma, caused by infectious agents, neither present nor incubating at the time of hospital admission. It is defined as pneumonia developing 48 h after admission to the hospital.

Divided into ICU HAP or non‐ICU HAP depending upon whether this infection is acquired in the intensive care unit (ICU) or in other clinical areas (e.g. wards)

✨“Nosocomial” Pneumonia
Hospital‐acquired pneumonia (HAP):

Occurs 48 hours or more after admission, which was not incubating at the time of admission

Ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP):
Arises more than 48‐72 hours after endotracheal intubation
Healthcare‐associated pneumonia (HCAP)
-Patients who were hospitalized in an acute care hospital for two or more days within 90 days of the infection; resided in a nursing home; received recent IV, chemotherapy, or wound care within the past 30 days of the current infection; or
attended a hospital or hemodialysis clinic
Early‐onset HAP (and VAP) is defined as pneumonia occurring within the first 4 days
of hospitalization (or endotracheal intubation.
It usually carries a better prognosis and is more likely to be caused by antibiotic‐sensitive bacteria.
Late‐onset HAP and VAP (day 5 or thereafter) are more likely to be caused by MDR

Basic principles:

Start antibiotics as early as possible.The exact choice of antibiotic to be started is based on local availability, antibiotic
resistance patterns, preferred routes of delivery, other complicating factors, and cost.
The initial combination therapy should be converted to appropriate monotherapy once
culture reports are available.
