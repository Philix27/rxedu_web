# PHARMACOTHERAPY OF DIABETES MELLITUS

Definition of Diabetes mellitus
Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder in which the body cannot metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and proteins because of a lack of, or ineffective use of, the hormone insulin.Type 2 diabetes is largely under diagnosed and about one third of people with diabetes do not know that they have it, and up to 25% of newly diagnosed diabetic patients already had micro vascular complications, which suggests that there is a 6- to 7-year time lag between the onset and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
[09/01, 2:19 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and
[09/01, 2:19 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia.
Long-term complications of diabetes include Microvascular (i.e retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure) risk reduction is accomplished through control of glycemia and blood pressure; and macrovascular (ie, coronary, cerebrovascular, peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints) risk reduction is through control of lipids and hypertension, smoking cessation, and aspirin therapy.

Classification of Diabetes mellitus:
The classification of diabetes includes four clinical classes:

•Type 1 diabetes (results from beta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)

•Type 2 diabetes (results from a progressive insulin secretory defect on the background of insulin resistance)
[09/01, 2:20 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: secondary diabetes or other specific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., genetic defects in beta-cell function, genetic defects in insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis), and drug- or chemical-induced (such as in the treatment of HIV/AIDS or after organ transplantation)
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy that is not clearly overt diabetes)

TYPE 1 (previously called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile onset diabetes)

•Type 1 diabetes, which accounts for only 5–10% of those with diabetes,results from a cellular mediated autoimmune destruction of the b-cells of the pancreas. Markers of the immune destruction of the beta-cell include islet cell autoantibodies, autoantibodies to insulin, autoantibodies to GAD (GAD65), and autoantibodies to the tyrosine phosphatases IA-2 and IA-
[09/01, 2:20 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #In this form of diabetes, the rate of beta-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (mainly infants and children) and slow in others (mainly adults). Some patients, particularly children and adolescents, may present with ketoacidosis as the first manifestation of the disease.Others have modest fasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycemia and/or ketoacidosis in the presence of infection or other stress. Still others, particularly adults, may retain residual beta-cell function sufficient to prevent ketoacidosis for many years; such individuals eventually become dependent on insulin for survival and are at risk for ketoacidosis. At this latter stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, as manifested by low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide.
[09/01, 2:22 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #Type 2 DM:

Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 90–95% of those with diabetes, previously referred to as non–insulin dependent diabetes, type 2 diabetes, oradult-onset diabetes, encompasses individuals who have insulin resistance and usually have relative (rather than absolute) insulin deficiency. There are different causes of this form of diabetes.

Although the specific etiologies are not known, autoimmune destruction of beta-cells does not occur.

Most patients with this form of diabetes are obese, and obesity itself causes some degree of insulin resistance.
In type 2 diabetes, Ketoacidosis seldomoccurs spontaneously and when it does occurs, it usually arises inassociation with the stress of anotherillness such as infection. This form ofdiabetes frequently goes undiagnosedfor many years because thehyperglycemia develops gradually andat earlier stages is often not severeenough for the patient to notice any ofthe classic symptoms of diabetes.
[09/01, 2:23 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #Other Specific Types of Diabetes:

•Genetic Defects of the beta -Cell:
Several forms of diabetes are associated with monogenetic defects in b-cell function. These forms of diabetes are frequently characterized by onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (generally before age 25 years). They are referred to as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and are characterized by impaired insulin secretion with minimal or no defects in insulin action.
Genetic Defects in Insulin Action.

There are unusual causes of diabetes that result from genetically determined abnormalities of insulin action. •The metabolic abnormalities associated with mutations of the insulin receptor may range from hyperinsulinemia and modest hyperglycemia to severe diabetes. Some individuals with these mutations may have acanthosis nigricans.
[09/01, 2:23 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #Diseases of the Exocrine Pancrease:

Any process that diffusely injures the pancreas can cause diabetes. Acquired processes include pancreatitis, trauma, infection, pancreatectomy, and pancreatic carcinoma. With the exception of that caused by cancer, damage to the pancreas must be extensive for diabetes to occur;
Endocrinopathies
Several hormones (e.g., growth hormone, cortisol, glucagon, epinephrine) antagonize insulin action. Excess amounts of these hormonese.gacromegaly, Cushing’s syndrome, glucagonoma, pheochromocytomacan cause diabetes. This generally occurs in individuals with preexisting defects in insulin secretion, and hyperglycemia typically resolves when the hormone excess is resolved. Somatostatinomas and aldosteronomainducedhypokalemia can cause diabetes, by inhibiting insulin secretion. Hyperglycemia generally resolves after successful removal of the tumor.
[09/01, 2:24 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #Let's take a look at Gestational diabetes!

GESTATIONAL DIABETES
GDM is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.

Screening for and diagnosis of GDM
“One-step” (IADPSG consensus)
Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at24–28 weeks of gestation in women not previously diagnosed with overt diabetes.The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h.The diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values areexceeded:
Fasting: ≥92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)
1 h: ≥180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
2 h: ≥153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)

PRE DIABETES
Is a state whereby the glucose levels do not meet criteria for diabetes but are higher than those considered normal. These people
[09/01, 2:25 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #were defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [fasting plasma glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) which are risk factors for the future development of diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease.

IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.
Structured lifestyle intervention, aimed at increasing physical activity and producing 5–10% loss of body weight, and certain pharmacological agents have been demonstrated to prevent or delay the development of diabetes inpeople with IGT;

How do we test for Diabetics?

DIAGNOSIS:

Testing For Diabetes In Asymptomatic Patients
Recommendations
Testing to detect type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI > or equal

to 25 kg/m2) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45, If tests are normal, repeat testing at least at 3-year intervals is reasonable.

To test for diabetes or prediabetes, the A1C, FPG, or 75-g 2-h OGTT are appropriate.
In those identified with prediabetes, treat otherCVD risk factors.

What are the risk factor's to Diabetes?

RISK FACTORS

Age: risk increases with age over 40 years increases the risk
Family history: a person is 2-6 times likely to get type 2 diabetes if the parents, brother of child has diabetes
Race: 2-4 times more likely in blacks
History of HBP, Heart Attack or Stroke
Antipsychotic medication E.G Chlorpromazine, Clozapine, Risperidol
Women with polycystic ovaries,

ovaries, gestational DM
Prediabetes

Categories of increased risk for diabetes (prediabetes)
FPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (IFG)
2-h PG in the 75-g OGTT 140 mg/Dl (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL
(11.0 mmol/L) (IGT)
HbA1c 5.7–6.4%

Criteria For The Diagnosis of Diabetes:

A1C ≥ 6.5%. The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay. OR

[09/01, 2:26 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES:

Hyperglycemia is produced by relative lack of endogenous insulin. Relative insulin deficiency usually occurs because of inadequate response by the pancreatic beta cell and due to resistance to the actions of insulin in muscle, fat, and the liver. This patho-physiologic abnormality results in decreased glucose transport in muscle, elevated hepatic glucose production, and increased breakdown of fat. Type II diabetes is characterized by two defects: insulin resistance and insulin deficiency relative to resistance.To overcome the insulin resistance, beta islets increase the amount of insulin secreted. Higher circulating insulin levels will overcome the impedance to action of insulin.

The core pathophysiologic defects in type 2 diabetes includes;

impaired insulin secretion (beta-cell), increased hepatic glucose production (liver), and decreased peripheral (muscle) glucose utilization (muscle) commonly referred to as the triumvirate or the classic triad. In addition to these are adipocyte insulin resistance (increased lipolysis), reduced incretin secretion/sensitivity (gastrointestinal), increased glucagon secretion (alpha-cell),
[09/01, 2:27 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES:

The goal of Management includes; minimizing long-term complications by lowering glycemia, lipids, blood pressure while avoiding severe hypoglycemic events.Ideally, blood glucose should be maintained at near-normal levels (preprandial levels of 90-130 mg/dL and postprandial level of 140mg/dl, HbA1c < 7%). However, focus on glucose alone does not provide adequate treatment for patients with diabetes mellitus. Aggressive glucose lowering may not be the best strategy in all patients. Individual risk stratification is highly recommended. In patients with

advanced type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, lowering HbA1c to 6% or lower may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

Management of type 2 Diabetes involves:
Non- Pharmacological (Lifestyle Modification)

Weight loss and exercise are important non-pharmacologicapproaches to improving glycemic control. The American Diabetes Association recommends a balanced diet that is rich in fiber, whole grains, and legumes; contains less than 7% saturated fat and reduced trans fats; and is limited in calories and foods with a high glycemic index.

Pharmacological Therapy: Guideline on initiation of therapy
The following factors should be considered when choosing medications: degree of hyperglycemia, risk of hypoglycemia, medication

effectiveness at reducing diabetes complications (microvascular and/or macrovascular), medication effects on body weight, medication side effects, concomitant medical conditions, ability to adhere to regimen and patient preferences.
When levels of glycemia are high(e.g., A1C =8.5%), classes with greater and more rapid glucose-lowering effectiveness e.ginsulin secretagogues (sulphonylureas, repaglinide, nateglinide) or potentially earlier initiation of combination therapy, are recommended; however, patients with recent-onset diabetes often respond adequately to less intensive interventions than those with longer-term disease. When glycemic levels are closer to the target levels (e.g A1C of 7.5%), medications with lesser potential to lower glycemia and/or a slower onset of action may be considered. Based on the results of the UKPDS and safety record, patients who are obese (120% ideal body weight) should be started on metformin initially, titrated to at least 2000

mg/d administered in divided doses (during or after meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects). Patients with near-normal weight may be treated with sulfonylureas or metformin initially. Initial therapy usually should result in addition of another class of drug rather than substitution (reserve substitution for intolerance to a drug due to adverse effects). An insulin secretagogue (usually titrated to no more than the half-maximal approved dose to reduce risk for hypoglycemia) should be added to or used initially in conjunction with metformin. Glitazonecan be used because of the positive effects of these drugs on inflammation and the vasculature. If 2 drugs are unsuccessful, the practitioner may consider adding a third class of oral agents. An alternative would be to add bedtime insulin, to the initial oral agent or 2-drug combinationor add the new injectable drug exenatide. If insulin is used, the insulin dose is titrated to the fasting sugar concentration, which

the patient can measure at home (usually with titration to a maximum bedtime insulin dose of approximately 60 units).The choice of glycemic goals and the medications used to achieve them must be individualized for each patient

The Therapeutic Agents include;
Biguanidese.g metformin are agents that reduce hepatic glucose production and lower fasting glycemia(ie, antihyperglycemics, hepatic insulin sensitizers). They slow absorption of glucose from the intestine and makes the body more sensitive to insulin. Insulin must be present for biguanides to work. Metformin has been shown to reduce the overall death rate of people with type 2diabetes more than by the effect it has on blood glucose levels.
Metforminis often considered to be the first-choice medication in management of type 2 diabetes in patients who are overweight
• Metformin should not be used by people with severe liver, kidney,

or heart disease.
• Metformin may need to be stopped before and immediately after surgery or
procedures that require a radio-opaque dye such as a coronary angiogram.
• It is rarely prescribed for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
• Metformin may need to be combined with the sulphonylurea or other classes of tablets
and/or insulin.
• Metformin by itself does not cause hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose or ‘hypo’) but
may contribute to hypoglycaemia when used in conjunction with a sulphonylurea/insulin
Side effects: nausea, diarrhea and metallic taste in the mouth
To reduce side effects tablets should be taken with or after a meal
They need to be started at a low dose and then increase slowly

2.Sulfonylureas are insulin secretagoguesi.e they lower glycemia by enhancing insulin

[09/01, 2:32 pm] #PharmahubNG▫️: #secretion (Oral hypoglycemic agents).Chlorpropamide and glibenclamide are associated with a substantially greater risk of hypoglycemia than other second-generation sulfonylureas- gliclazide, glimepiride, glipizide. Although the onset of the glucose lowering effect of sulfonylurea monotherapy is relatively rapid compared with, for example, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), maintenance of glycemic targets over time is not as good as monotherapy with a TZD or metformin.

GLIPIZIDE Melizide, Minidiab 5mg. 10mg
GLIMEPIRIDE Amaryl, 1m

sulphonylureas
• They lower blood glucose levels by stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin.
• They can cause hypoglycaemia.
• Tablets should be taken just before a meal.
• Side effects can include weight gain and rarely skin rashes, stomach upsets and jaundice.
• Should not be taken by women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
• Sulphonylureas may need to be combined with metformin and other classes of tablets
and/or insulin.

MeglitinidesLike the sulfonylureas, the glinides stimulate insulin secretion, although
they bind to a different site within the sulfonylurea receptor. They are much more short-acting insulin secretagogues than sulfonylureas, with preprandial dosing potentially achieving more physiologic insulin release and less risk for hypoglycemia. Their glycemic efficacy is possibly less than sulfonylureas. Examples;

Repaglinide, Nateglinide. The risk of weight gain is like that for the sulfonylureas, but hypoglycemia may be less frequent, at least with nateglinide, than with some sulfonylureas.

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors e.g Acarbosereduce the rate of digestion of polysaccharides in the proximal small intestine, primarily prolonging the absorption of carbohydrates and lowering postprandial glucose levels without causing hypoglycemia. Their induction of flatulence greatly limits their use. These agents should be titrated slowly to reduce gastrointestinal intolerance. Their effect on glycemic control is modest, affecting primarily postprandial glycemic excursions.

Chemical name Brand name
ACARBOSE Glucobay
Points to remember about alpha glucosidase inhibitors
• They help to slow down the digestion and absorption of certain dietary carbohydrates

in the gut (intestine). Taken on their own, they don’t cause hypoglycaemia.
• They can be taken together with other classes of medication including insulin.
• If hypoglycaemia occurs, due to another diabetes tablet or insulin you may be taking,
it must be treated with pure glucose such as glucose tablets, gel or Lucozade. This is
because taking Glucobay may result in reduced or too slow absorption of other forms
of quick acting carbohydrates.
• Side effects include flatulence (wind), bloating and diarrhoea.
• They need to be started at low doses and increased slowly to reduce side effects.
• They need to be taken just before eating.
• They should not be taken by women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

Thiazolidinediones (glitazones)(pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are peroxisome proliferator–activated

receptorγ activators that enhance insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and reduce hepatic glucose production. The PPAR gamma, a nuclear transcription factor, is important in fat cell differentiation and fatty acid metabolism.Their major action is probably fat redistribution. They are the most expensive oral agents. Glitazones require the presence of insulin to work. They generally decrease triglycerides and increase HDL-C, but they increase LDL-C (perhaps large buoyant LDL, which may be less atherogenic).

Side effects are; edema and weight gain especially when administered with insulin or insulin secretagogues. These effects may induce or worsen congestive heart failure. There is increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart-related deaths

Chemical name Brand names
ROSIGLITAZONE (Avandia) 2mg
PIOGLITAZONE (Actos) 15mg, 30mg..

Points to remember about:

thiazolidinediones (glitazones)• They help to lower blood glucose levels by increasing the effect of your own insulin,
especially on muscle and fat cells ie: they improve insulin resistance.
• Their effect is slow, taking days to weeks to begin working and one to two months
for their full effect.
• They work well together with some of the other diabetes tablets.
• Taken on their own, they do not cause hypoglycaemia, but this can occur when they
are taken with a sulphonylurea.
• Weight gain can be a side effect. Fat may shift from areas where it is bad for your
health (around the waist) to other areas such as the top of the thighs
• Fluid accumulation and should generally be avoided by in heart failure.
• They should not be taken by people who have liver disease.
• They should not be taken by women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
• It is recommended that regulate

checks of liver function are done particularly in the first
year of taking these tablets..

The incretin-mimetic, exenatide, has a novel mechanism of action, mimicking the endogenous incretin- aglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Incretinmimetics are injected medications. They mimic the effects of the body’s own‘incretin hormones’ which help to manage blood glucose levels after meals.• Exenatide helps to lower blood glucose levels by:

- stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin in response to eating
  Carbohydrates, reducing the amount of glucagon released from the pancreas after a meal, slowing down the passage of food from the stomach to the gut so that food is
  absorbed more slowly and steadily,slow gastric emptying and increasing a feeling of fullness after eatingresulting in a weight loss of approximately 2 to 4 kg

EXENATIDE (Byetta) 250mcg/ml
Points to remember about incretin mimetics
• Currently Byetta is only prescribed when the maximum doses of either metformin or
asulphonylurea, or a combination of both fails to achieve an HbA1c equal to or less
than 7% (or 53mmol/mol).

The Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor, sitagliptin, which gained FDA approval in October 2006. DPP-4 degrades numerous biologically active peptides including the endogenous incretins GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). Sitagliptin can be used as a monotherapy or in combination with metformin or the thiazolidinediones. It is a once daily drug and is weight neutral. Another DPP-4 inhibitor, vildagliptin, is currently under review at the FDA.
Chemical name Brand name
LINAGLIPTIN (Trajenta) 5mg once daily
SAXAGLIPTIN (Onglyza) 2.5mg or

5mg once daily taken regardless of meals
SITAGLIPTIN (Januvia) 25mg , 50mg. 100mg daily
VILDAGLIPTIN (Galvus) 50mg, 100mg daily(50mg bd)
Points to remember about DPP-4 inhibitors
• They work by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4. This enhances the levels of active incretin
hormones which act to lower blood glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion and
decreasing glucagon secretion (a hormone that has the opposite effect of insulin by
increasing blood glucose levels).
• By themselves, they are unlikely to cause hypoglycaemia because they do not work
when blood glucose levels are low.
• Sitagliptin and saxagliptin are used in combination with certain other oral diabetes
medications (metformin, sulphonylurea such as glimepiride and glibenclamide, or
rosiglitazone and pioglitazone), when healthy eating and physical

plus the single
oral medication does not provide adequate blood glucose management.
• Vildagliptin is used in combination with certain other oral medications (metformin,
sulphonylurea, or pioglitazone), when healthy eating and physical activity plus the
single medication does not provide adequate blood glucose management.

• They should not be used if you are under 18 years of age, are pregnant or intend
to become pregnant, while breastfeeding or if planning to breastfeed, or for the
management of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. If you have kidney or liver
problems, your doctor may prescribe lower doses.
• They are not likely to cause weight gain.

Let's talk about emergencies----

DIADETIC EMERGENCIES
There are two types of hyperglycemic emergencies:

1.diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and
2.hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state(HHS).

These situations require emergency medical intervention, since they can lead to serious conditions such as coma, even death, if left untreated.Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are due to insufficient insulin

√Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)

Diabetic ketoacidosis mainly occurs in people with type 1 diabetes. It is characterized by hyperglycemia often greater than 20 mmol/L, with the presence of ketones in the blood or urine.Ketones are produced from the breakdown of fats. Their accumulation in the blood is toxic for the body. This situation arises when the body lacks insulin and must use its fat reserves for the energy it normally gets from glucose.Diabetic ketoacidosis can arise due to a forgotten or skipped insulin dose, an improper adjustment to the insulin dose,

untreated.Lack of insulin is the cause. However, contrary to diabeticketoacidosis, in HHS there is normally no significant presence of ketones in the blood or urine because insulin is not totally absent.The symptoms are typical of hyperglycemia, including frequent and abundant urination, intense thirst and exhaustion, as well as such signs of dehydration as dry mouth, sunken eyes, dry skin, etc.People with kidney problems are more susceptible to HHS because their kidneys are less efficient in eliminating excess glucose in the blood when hyperglycemic.The elderly are less aware of their own thirst, so are consequently more at risk.

HYPOGLYCEMIA:
Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood glucose (blood sugar) levels, usually less than 70 mg/dl. However, it is important to talk to your health care provider about your individual blood glucose targets, and what level is too low

for you.Hypoglycemia may also be referred to as an insulin reaction, or insulin shock.

Hypoglycemic symptoms are important clues that you have low blood glucose. Each person's reaction to hypoglycemia is different, so it's important that you learn your own signs and symptoms when your blood glucose is low.

Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia:

•Shakiness
•Nervousness or anxiety
Sweating, chills and clamminess
•Irritability or impatience
Confusion, including delirium
Rapid/fast heartbeat
•Lightheadedness or dizziness
Hunger and nausea
Sleepiness
Blurred/impaired vision
Tingling or numbness in the lips or tongue
Headaches
Weakness or fatigue
Anger, stubbornness, or sadness
Lack of coordination
Nightmares or crying out during

Treatment: Consume 15-20 grams of glucose or simple carbohydratesGlucagon

If left untreated, hypoglycemia may lead to a seizure or unconsciousness (passing out, a coma). Glucagon is a hormone that stimulates the liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream when blood glucose levels are too low.

Insulin and insulin analogues
Insulin is the most potent agent for reducing glycemia. By activating plasma-membrane receptors, it stimulates glucose uptake by responsive tissues and decreases hepatic glucose production. The use of insulin causes weight gain and may cause severe hypoglycemia.
Insulin therapy is required for all patients with type 1 DM and for those with type 2 DM when oral antidiabetes therapy alone does not

Please take note of this type of Insulin injections:

There are also premixed insulin products that give rapid or short acting insulin as a pre meal bolus plus an intermediate acting insulin to control later hyperglycemia.

Subcutaneous injection is used in routine administration of insulin, in most patient absorption of regular insulin is fastest from the abdomen, followed by the arm, buttocks, and thigh. The injection site should be rotated to avoid lipohypertrophy andfibrosis.
