# PHARMACOTHERAPY OF Common Cold & Cough:-

The common cold is a self-limited contagious disease that can be caused by a number of different types of viruses. The common cold is medically referred to as a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Symptoms of the common cold may include cough, sore throat, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing. More than 200 different types of viruses are known to cause the common cold, with rhinovirus causing approximately 30%-40% of all adult colds.

Rhinovirus multiplies best at temperatures found in the nose.

Rhinovirus infection rates peak from September to November and March to May.

Nevertheless, rhinovirus may cause disease at any time of year. During peak periods, up to 80% of colds may be due to rhinovirus.

Other commonly implicated viruses include coronavirus (COVID-19), adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus. Because so many different viruses can cause the common cold, and because new cold viruses constantly develop, the body never builds up resistance against all of them. For this reason, colds are a frequent and recurring problem. In fact, children in preschool and elementary school can have six to 12 colds per year while adolescents and adults typically have two to four colds per year.

✨How does the common cold spread?

The common cold is spread either by direct contact with infected secretions from contaminated surfaces or by inhaling the airborne virus after individuals sneeze or cough. Person-to-person transmission often occurs when an individual who has a cold blows or touches their nose and then touches someone or something else. A healthy individual who then makes direct contact with these secretions can subsequently become infected, often after their contaminated hands contact their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
✨A cold virus can live on frequently touched objects such as doorknobs, pens, books, cell phones, computer keyboards, and coffee cups for several hours and can thus be acquired from contact with these objects

risk factors for acquiring the common cold?

There are various risk factors that may increase the chances of acquiring the common cold, including the following:

▪️Age: Infants and young children are more likely to develop the common cold because they have not yet developed immunity to many of the implicated viruses.

▪️Seasonal variation: Individuals more commonly acquire the common cold during the fall, winter, or during the rainy season (in warmer climates). This is felt to occur because people tend to stay indoors and are in closer proximity to one another.

▪️Weakened immune system: Individuals with a poorly functioning immune system are more likely to develop the common cold. Also, individuals with excessive fatigue or emotional distress may be more susceptible to catching the common cold.

✨symptoms and incubation period of the common cold?

Common cold symptoms typically begin two to three days after acquiring the infection (incubation period), though this may vary depending on the type of virus causing the infection. Individuals also tend to be most contagious during the initial two to three days of having symptoms. Cold viruses target mainly the upper respiratory tract (nose, sinuses, and throat).

✨Symptoms and signs of the common cold may also vary depending on the virus responsible for the infection and may include;

▪️stuffy nose or nasal drainage,

▪️sore or scratchy throat,

▪️sneezing,

▪️hoarseness,

▪️cough,

▪️low-grade fever,

▪️headache,

▪️earache,

▪️body aches,

▪️loss of appetite, and

▪️fatigue.

✨What are the stages of the common cold?
Because the common cold can be caused by so many different viruses, the progression and severity of symptoms vary from individual to individual.
✨In general, symptoms will develop two to three days after the virus is contracted. Some individuals will develop very mild symptoms whereas others will develop more severe symptoms.

✨The type of symptoms will also vary, with some individuals developing only nasal congestion, while others may develop many or all of the symptoms described above. The symptoms that develop also depend on the underlying health of the person infected.

✨Most colds will resolve after seven to 10 days, though some individuals experience a shorter course and others a more prolonged illness, again depending on the particular virus involved, as well as the infected person's underlying health issues

✨What is the treatment for the common cold? Are there any home remedies for the common cold?

There is no cure for the common cold. The common cold is a self-limiting illness that will resolve spontaneously with time and expectant management. Home remedies and medical treatments are directed at alleviating the symptoms associated with the common cold while the body fights off the infection.

✨Home treatment for upper respiratory infections includes getting rest and drinking plenty of fluids. In older children and adults, common over-the-counter drugs such as throat lozenges, throat sprays, cough drops, and cough syrups may help relieve symptoms, though they will not prevent or shorten the duration of the common cold. Gargling with warm saltwater may help people with sore throats. Decongestant drugs such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) or antihistamines may be used for nasal symptoms, while saline nasal sprays may also be beneficial. It is important to note that over-the-counter medications may cause undesirable side effects, therefore they must be taken with care and as directed. Pregnant women should discuss the safety of common over-the-counter medications with their pharmacist or health care professional.

Acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are common over-the-counter medicines that can help with fever, sore throat, headache, and body aches.

✨The treatment for infants and small children with the common cold is supportive as well.
It is especially important to allow rest and encourage plenty of fluids in order to prevent dehydration. Nasal drops and bulb suctioning may be used to clear nasal mucus from the nasal passages in infants.
✨Medicines such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may be taken for pain or fever based on the package recommendations for age and weight.
✨Do not use aspirin or aspirin-containing medications in children or teenagers because it has been associated with a rare, potentially fatal condition called Reye's syndrome. Finally, over-the-counter cough and cold medications for infants and young children are not recommended.
✨ over-the-counter cough and cold drugs not be used in children younger than 4 years of age because of serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.

✨Common alternative treatments to prevent or treat the common cold, such as vitamin C, zinc, echinacea, and other herbal remedies, have had mixed results in studies evaluating their effectiveness.

✨Complications:
Complications that may arise from the common cold include;
the development of a bacterial middle ear infection (otitis media) or bacterial sinusitis.
In individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the common cold can sometimes trigger an exacerbation of their illness, leading to shortness of breath and increased wheezing.
Though uncommon, pneumonia can sometimes develop as a secondary infection in individuals with the common cold. For example, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and several other cold-causing viruses can cause bronchitis and pneumonia in people with very weakened immune systems.

✨PREVENTION:
The most important prevention measure for the common cold is to avoid contact with infected individuals. Other measures for prevention of the common cold include the following:

▪️Frequent and thorough hand washing during flu and cold season is extremely important, as this can destroy viruses acquired from touching contaminated surfaces. In between using soap and water when hands are visibly dirty, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

▪️Disinfect frequently touched surfaces or personal objects with a product that is effective against flu and cold-causing viruses (and safe for the type of surface).

▪️Do not share personal belongings such as towels, handkerchiefs, or tissues.

▪️Avoid sharing utensils and try to use disposable items (such as disposable cups) if someone in the family has a cold.

▪️Encourage individuals to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing to prevent transmission of the virus. A sneeze can spray a fine mist of contagious droplets up to 6 feet.

▪️Lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation and stress management may decrease susceptibility to acquiring the common cold.

▪️If the air in the home is very dry during the winter, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer may be helpful.
