# ğŸ“Œ Pharmacotherapy of skin infection:

Your skin is your body's largest organ. It has many different functions, including covering and protecting your body. It helps keep germs out. But sometimes the germs can cause a skin infection. This often happens when there is a break, cut, or wound on your skin. It can also happen when your immune system is weakened, because of another disease or a medical treatment.

Some skin infections cover a small area on the top of your skin. Other infections can go deep into your skin or spread to a larger area.

âœ¨ Aetiology:
Skin infections are caused by different kinds of germs. For example,

Bacteria causeÂ cellulitis,Â impetigo, andÂ staphylococcal (staph) infections

Viruses causeÂ shingles,Â warts, andÂ herpes simplex

Fungi causeÂ athlete's footÂ andÂ yeast infections

Parasites causeÂ body lice,Â head lice, andÂ scabies

âœ¨Risk Factors:
You are at a higher risk for a skin infection if you

Have poor circulation

HaveÂ diabetes

Are older

Have anÂ immune system disease, such asÂ HIV/AIDS

Have a weakened immune system because ofÂ chemotherapyÂ or other medicines that suppress your immune system

Have to stay in one position for a long time, such as if you are sick and have to stay in bed for a long time or you are paralyzed

AreÂ malnourished

Have excessive skinfolds, which can happen if you haveÂ obesity

âœ¨Symptoms:
The symptoms depend on the type of infection. Some symptoms that are common to many skin infections includeÂ rashes, swelling, redness, pain, pus, andÂ itching.

âœ¨ Diagnoses:

To diagnose a skin infection, health care providers will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You may have lab tests, such as a skin culture. This is a test to identify what type of infection you have, using a sample from your skin. Your provider may take the sample by swabbing or scraping your skin, or removing a small piece of skin (biopsy). Sometimes providers use other tests, such as blood tests.

âœ¨ Treatment:
Summarily, treatment depends on the type of infection and how serious it is. Some infections will go away on their own. When you do need treatment, it may include a cream or lotion to put on the skin.
