# DRF or RDF: Revolving Drug Fund

One of the methods for financing medicines is a RDF, in which after an initial capital investment, drug supplies are replenished with monies collected from the sales of drugs. The challenge for raising sufficient funds for the scheme is always there, more so when people are poor and cannot afford the service. RDF schemes serves drugs at cost price plus a mark up and revenue is used to replenish stock. It is a way to guarantee good quality drugs direct from manufacturers at affordable costs. RDF eliminates intermediaries who often mark up prices excessively. RDF is a very effective strategy for ensuring uninterrupted drug supply in the health care delivery system.

SUMMARY:.
Drug Revolving Funds (DRF) are a scheme where drugs and medical consumables are sold at cost-price, plus a mark-up, and the revenue is used to replenish stocks, while ensuring that the drugs remain affordable to those who need them.
[31/01, 8:32 pm] ▫️#PharmahubNG: 💥HOW CAN THE IDEA OF A DRF BE SUCCESSFULLY INITIATED in the hospital?

To Ensure RDF Success
💥A good cost accounting system must be in place.
💥A good (Logistics) Management Information System (L)MIS must also be designed
💥You must be ready to repackage and pre-package to suit your standard therapeutic regimen.
💥Sufficient mark ups should be made to cover inflation, exempt treatment, currency devaluation and transportation costs.
💥Reliable sources of quality medicines must be identified.
💥Monitoring, evaluation and reporting on project activities at RDF facilities should be done. 💥The supervision teams should move drugs that are nearing their expiry dates from over stocked to under stocked facilities.
💥There is a need to keep adequate records. Any decline in drugs and funds should be established and justified.
💥Advocacy to gain support for the scheme.
💥The use of appropriate mix of personnel.
💥Prescribing habits should be taken into consideration before purchase of RDF drugs.
💥Implementation must be holistic (seen as a whole)
💥Money making potentials must not distract the preventive measures or essence.
💥Try to increase coverage of the scheme to 100%
Provision of adequate training for the RDF personnel.
💥Provision of adequate capital for the procurement of required drugs.
💥Maintenance of a separate account for the RDF scheme which shall be used exclusively for drug purchasing
💥Ensuring strict accountability for the drugs provided in the system by supplying them on a ‘’ cash and carry basis’’
[31/01, 8:34 pm] ▫️#PharmahubNG: 💥 Example⚡

Situation:

Drug Revolving Funds (DRF) are a scheme where drugs and medical consumables are sold at cost-price, plus a mark-up, and the revenue is used to replenish stocks, while ensuring that the drugs remain affordable to those who need them. The DRF system, when implemented at maximum capacity, has the potential to promote access and ensure the availability, affordability, and sustainability of quality drugs and medical consumables.

However, DRF schemes in select states in Nigeria were facing challenges, including lack of drug availability and accessibility, high level of either sub-standard, adulterated or fake drugs in circulation across the country, as well as limited accountability, transparency and capacity within the DRF management system – which severely limited the sustainability of the system.

Solution:

Akesis, as part of the consortia that implemented the following projects:

As part of two DfID-funded projects, the Partnership for Transforming Health Systems Phase 2 (PATHS 2) (2009 to 2014) and Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health Phase 2 (MNCH 2) (2014 to 2019), Akesis was responsible for strengthening the DRF schemes in select states in Nigeria.

To accomplish this, Akesis helped the states set up Drug Management Agencies backed up by a legal framework.

We also worked to establish and strengthen public service and community-based accountability structures, build capacity of those operating the DRF scheme, and strengthen operational systems, such as procurement, warehousing, distribution, record keeping and reporting, among others.

Results:

> Set up Kano State Drugs and Medical Consumables Supply Agency, including four zonal stores strategically located to better reach all 700+ health facilities running the DRF scheme in the state> Increased procurements from NGN 22,650,000.27 to NGN 945,389,333.96 per annum. In addition, the procurement pattern shifted from an emergency procurement system to a contract agreement procurement system, helping to improve the affordability and consistency of DRF item prices.

> Achieved balance between procurement and sales, supporting program sustainability.

> Minimized rate of DRF drug expiry as a result of continuous capacity building efforts.

> Decreased percentage expiry in relation to procurement from 11.35% between 2008-2009 to 0.08% between 2014-2015.

> Increased availability of tracer drugs in health facilities (from 25% of drugs available in 2007 to 93% available in 2014).

Barriers to the Scheme:
-Insufficient funding
-Undue political interference
-Inadequate managerial and financial autonomy
-Barriers to access to the very poor and vulnerable because of user fees.
-Poor capacity of facility staff
Operation guidelines may not be sensitive to the local environment.
-Lack of culture of transparency and accountability
-Resistance to change by the facility staff
-Poor policy implementation
-Delayed delivery of the drugs
-Misapplication of Fund
-Lumping of proceeds of the Fund into a general account.
-Non reimbursement for the costs of drugs for exempted patients
[31/01, 8:38 pm] ▫️#PharmahubNG: These and many more are the major hindrance to DRF, even major hospitals do not have an equitable DRF system...
[31/01, 8:41 pm] ▫️#PharmahubNG: #how can this problems be tackled and wasted costs recovered?

To Recover Cost in the Scheme, we can assume this process/procedure
💥Cost recovery scheme may be designed to achieve the following:
-Recover all costs pumped into the scheme (staff, drugs, volunteer etc)
-Recover drug costs and operating costs only.
Or recover
-Partial costs of drug recovery
-All drug costs only
-Operating costs only
Or a combination of all the above mentioned costs.
[31/01, 8:47 pm] ▫️#PharmahubNG: Take note of this demerits:

Some reasons why, DRF may Failure:

💥 Reasons for the possible failure of a
Revolving Fund

1. Who owns the Revolving Fund is not clearly established
2. The hospital management may not be designed to manage credits
3. The Revolving Fund is only a part of a whole range of activities
4. The other activities are free of charge or subsidized
5. Subsidies and credit are confused
6. By means of the Revolving Fund, attempts are made to introduce  
   innovations which have not been validated at farm level
7. It remains unclear who assumes the risk
8. Collective production is favored at the expense of the traditional  
   method of production based on the individual
9. Small portfolios with high administrative costs are established
10. The interest rates fixed are low or non-existent
11. Loan guarantees are neglected.
    [31/01, 8:54 pm] ▫️#PharmahubNG: #Requirements for Setting-up a DRF:[take note)

A DRF requires a number of factors to enable its setting up and these include:

✓Political will from government and implementers.
✓A DRF management committee should be set up - the ward health committee can play this role. ✓Someone representing the Local Government (LG) health committee can also be included in the proposed DRF committee.

✓It is needful for a pharmacist to be included in the committee who will serve as the secretary.
✓There should be adequate staffing with relevant and competent operators.
✓The functions of the operators should be cleanly delineated i.e. the DRF committee, medical store staff and facility staff.
✓Relevant technical staff should be involved in procurement of drugs in-line with Edo State public procurement law, National drug policy, National health policy, and other pertinent regulations e.g. PHC drug code. ✓Technical staff should carry out drug selection, quantification and tender management.
✓Efficient inventory control with the support tools.
✓DRF bank account: There should be a dedicated account for DRF financial operations.
✓In communities where there is no bank a safe should be installed in the dispensary.
✓A warehouse and other things necessary for proper warehousing; this will serve as the medical store and should be located at the LGA headquarters.
✓There should be a Health Centre store, Dispensary unit with a store, and a Delivery van
Monthly account report to management or DRF committee is a necessity
✓Insurance cover: There should be adequate insurance to cover losses to stock in transit as well as facility dispensary store. It may be necessary to also provide persons in custody of drug stocks fidelity insurance cover.
✓A Supervision/inspection team
A rational prescribing and correct drug dispensing (emphasis on EDL and generics)
Accounting records: The operators at all levels should use the DRF manual on financial management and accounting system. ✓Accounting records should be properly and promptly updated.
✓Internal and external audit: This is very vital as a check mechanism. External audit should be a must at the medical store level while at the facility level the internal auditor is used who should report to the head of the health centre.
✓Incentive payment: DRF operations increase the overall work load of the operators. They should be paid a form of incentive to ensure the success of the scheme. Every DRF staff is expected to be paid his/her basic salary as incentive.
✓Requisition system must be pull to avoid the expiring of drugs and other health commodities.
✓Cash and carry: All sales of drugs should be on cash and carry basis. No credit sales
Staff Drug ✓Consumption: Staff should pay for their drugs and be reimbursed by the LGA.
✓Training: Opportunities for the training of operators of the DRF should be provided regularly to enhance the quantity and quality of services rendered.
✓Management Information System (MIS): The appropriate indicator forms developed for the purpose of monitoring the DRF should be used as required. The information derived from the exercise should be appropriately disseminated and used to improve the system.
✓Pilferage/Theft: Acceptable loss due to pilferage should not exceed 2% while loss due to breakages and stock expiry should not exceed 3%.
✓Pricing: Retail pricing at the facility level should consider purchase price, transportation charges and markup to cover administrative and other costs.
✓Emergency patients: A clear policy on payments by emergency patients should be put in place. The use of emergency packs may be a way forward.
