# DIARRHEA PHARMACOTHERAPY REVISION:

Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old, and is responsible for killing around 525 000 children every year. Diarrhoea can last several days, and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. In the past, for most people, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of diarrhoea deaths. Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity as well as people living with HIV are most at risk of life-threatening diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea, nor is the passing of loose, "pasty" stools by breastfed babies.

Diarrhoea is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene.

Interventions to prevent diarrhoea, including safe drinking-water, use of improved sanitation and hand washing with soap can reduce disease risk. Diarrhoea should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS), a solution of clean water, sugar and salt. In addition, a 10-14 day supplemental treatment course of dispersible 20 mg zinc tablets shortens diarrhoea duration and improves outcomes.

There are three clinical types of diarrhoea:

acute watery diarrhoea – lasts several hours or days, and includes cholera;
acute bloody diarrhoea – also called dysentery; and
persistent diarrhoea – lasts 14 days or longer.
Scope of diarrhoeal disease
Diarrhoeal disease is a leading cause of child mortality and morbidity in the world, and mostly results from contaminated food and water sources. Worldwide, 780 million individuals lack access to improved drinking-water and 2.5 billion lack improved sanitation. Diarrhoea due to infection is widespread throughout developing countries.

In low-income countries, children under three years old experience on average three episodes of diarrhoea every year. Each episode deprives the child of the nutrition necessary for growth. As a result, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition, and malnourished children are more likely to fall ill from diarrhoea.

Dehydration
The most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. During a diarrhoeal episode, water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate) are lost through liquid stools, vomit, sweat, urine and breathing. Dehydration occurs when these losses are not replaced.

The degree of dehydration is rated on a scale of three.

Severe dehydration (at least two of the following signs):
lethargy/unconsciousness
sunken eyes
unable to drink or drink poorly
skin pinch goes back very slowly ( ≥2 seconds )
Some dehydration (two or more of the following signs):
restlessness, irritability
sunken eyes
drinks eagerly, thirsty
No dehydration (not enough signs to classify as some or severe dehydration).
Causes
Infection: Diarrhoea is a symptom of infections caused by a host of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms, most of which are spread by faeces-contaminated water. Infection is more common when there is a shortage of adequate sanitation and hygiene and safe water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Rotavirus and Escherichia coli, are the two most common etiological agents of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in low-income countries. Other pathogens such as cryptosporidium and shigella species may also be important. Location-specific etiologic patterns also need to be considered.

Malnutrition: Children who die from diarrhoea often suffer from underlying malnutrition, which makes them more vulnerable to diarrhoea. Each diarrhoeal episode, in turn, makes their malnutrition even worse. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under five

years old.

Source: Water contaminated with human faeces, for example, from sewage, septic tanks and latrines, is of particular concern. Animal faeces also contain microorganisms that can cause diarrhoea.

Other causes: Diarrhoeal disease can also spread from person-to-person, aggravated by poor personal hygiene. Food is another major cause of diarrhoea when it is prepared or stored in unhygienic conditions.Unsafe domestic water storage and handling is also an important risk factor. Fish and seafood from polluted water may also contribute to the disease.

Prevention and treatment
Key measures to prevent diarrhoea include:

access to safe drinking-water;
use of improved sanitation;
hand washing with soap;
exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life;
good personal and food hygiene;
health education about how infections spread; and
rotavirus vaccination.
Key measures to treat diarrhoea include the following:

Rehydration: with oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution. ORS is a mixture of clean water, salt and sugar. It costs a few cents per treatment. ORS is absorbed in the small intestine and replaces the water and electrolytes lost in the faeces.
Zinc supplements: zinc supplements reduce the duration of a diarrhoea episode by 25% and are associated with a 30% reduction in stool volume.
Rehydration: with intravenous fluids in case of severe dehydration or shock.
Nutrient-rich foods: the vicious circle of malnutrition and diarrhoea can be broken by continuing to give nutrient-rich foods – including breast milk – during an episode, and by giving a nutritious diet – including exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life – to children when they are well.
Consulting a health professional , in particular for management of persistent diarrhoea or when there is blood in stool or if there are signs of dehydration.
WHO response
WHO works with Member States and other partners to:

promote national policies and investments that support case management of diarrhoea and its complications as well as increasing access to safe drinking-water and sanitation in developing countries;
conduct research to develop and test new diarrhoea prevention and control strategies in this area;
build capacity in implementing preventive interventions, including sanitation, source water improvements, and household water treatment and safe storage;
develop new health interventions, such as the rotavirus immunization; and
help to train health workers, especially at community level.

●TODAY'S SUMMARY

Dysentery, infectious disease characterized by inflammation of the intestine, abdominal pain, and diarrhea with stools that often contain blood and mucus. Dysentery is a significant cause of illness and death in young children, particularly those who live in less-developed countries. There are two major types: bacillary dysentery and amebic dysentery, caused respectively by bacteria and by amoebas.

⚡Bacillary dysentery, or shigellosis, is caused by bacilli of the genus Shigella. Symptomatically, the disease ranges from a mild attack to a severe course that commences suddenly and ends in death caused by dehydration and poisoning by bacterial toxins. After an incubation period of one to six days, the disease has an abrupt onset with fever and the frequent production of watery stools that may contain blood. Vomiting may also occur, and dehydration soon becomes obvious owing to the copious loss of bodily fluids. In advanced stages of the disease, chronic ulceration of the large intestine causes the production of bloody stools.

⚡The most severe bacillary infections are caused by Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (formerly Shigella shigae), which is found chiefly in tropical and subtropical regions. S. flexneri, S. sonnei, and S. boydii are other Shigella bacilli that cause dysentery. Other types of bacterial infections, including salmonellosis (caused by Salmonella) and campylobacteriosis (caused by Campylobacter), can produce bloody stools and are sometimes also described as forms of bacillary dysentery. The treatment of bacillary dysentery is based on the use of antibiotics. The administration of fluids and, in some cases, blood transfusions may be necessary.
Amebic dysentery, or intestinal amebiasis, is caused by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. This form of dysentery, which traditionally occurs in the tropics, is usually much more chronic and insidious than the bacillary disease and is more difficult to treat because the causative organism occurs in two forms, a motile one and a cyst, each of which produces a different disease course. The motile form causes an acute dysentery, the symptoms of which resemble those of bacillary dysentery. The cyst form produces a chronic illness marked by intermittent episodes of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Bloody stools occur in some patients. The chronic type is the more common of the two and is marked by frequent remissions and exacerbations of symptoms. The chronic form may also produce ulcerations of the large intestine and pockets of infection in the liver. Both forms of amebic dysentery are treated with drugs that specifically kill the amebic parasites that thrive in the intestines.
⚡Dysentery is transmitted through the ingestion of food or water that has been contaminated by the feces of a human carrier of the infective organism. The transmission is often by infected individuals who handle food with unwashed hands. The spread of amebic dysentery is often accomplished by people who are carriers of the disease but who at the time show no symptoms. Dysentery is commonly found when people are crowded together and have access only to primitive sanitary facilities. Spread of the disease can be controlled by boiling drinking water and by adequately disposing of human waste to avoid the contamination of food.
[8/16, 3:30 PM] PharmaHub: ‼️ Pharmacotherapy of worm infestation:-

Worm infestation:
Helminths are parasitic worms that feed on a living host to gain nourishment and protection, while causing poor nutrient absorption, weakness and disease in the host. These worms and larvae live in the small bowel and are referred to as intestinal parasites.

The following groups of worms are classed as helminths:
•Nematodes or roundworms
•Trematodes, which includes flukes or flatworms
•Cestodes or tapeworms
•Monogenans, also members of the flatworm phylum

Helminths all share a similar morphology and are multicellular organisms that are visible to the naked eye. The worms are usually caught through treading on contaminated soil in warm, humid countries that have poor sanitation and hygiene.

If an infected person or animal has defecated on soil, helminth eggs present in their feces contaminate the soil. These eggs mature and hatch to produce larvae that grow into adult worms of up to 13 mm in length. These adult worms can penetrate human skin, which can happen if a person walks on contaminated soil. The worms then enter the bloodstream and migrate towards the lungs and also the throat where they are swallowed and transported to the gut.

Some of the features of the different groups of the helminths include:

▫️The trematodes or flatworms are flat, leaf-shaped and unsegmented. They are hermaphroditic, meaning they have the reproductive organs associated with both males and females.

▪️Nematodes are cylindrical and have lips, teeth and dentary plates. The worms are either male or female.

▪️The cestodes or tapeworm is segmented and hermaphroditic. They have a sucker and a projecting, hooked rostellum

Common symptoms of intestinal worms are:

▪️abdominal pain.

▪️diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.

▪️gas/bloating.

▪️fatigue.

▪️unexplained weight loss.

▪️abdominal pain or tenderness.

Diagnosis:

So, worm infestations are diagnosed via,;

Physical examination- where you clerk and treat patients based on compliant.

Laboratory investigations: which entails stool analysis or radiographic imaging

✨Risk factors:

▪️Children are particularly susceptible to intestinal worms. That’s because they may play in environments with contaminated soil, such as sandboxes and school playgrounds. Older adults are also at increased risk due to weakened immune systems.

▪️According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 10 percentTrusted Source of people in the developing world are infected with intestinal worms. People in developing countries are at the highest risk due to drinking water from contaminated sources and because of decreased sanitation levels.

✨TREATMENT:
Some types of intestinal worms, such as tapeworms, may disappear on their own if you have a strong immune system and healthy diet and lifestyle. However, depending on the type of intestinal worm infection, one may require treatment with an antiparasitic medication. Serious symptoms shouldn’t be ignored.
Treatment should be initiated when,:

▫️have blood or pus in your stool

▫️are vomiting daily or frequently

▫️have an elevated body temperature

▫️are extremely fatigued and dehydrated
treatment plan will be determined based on the type of intestinal worm you have and your symptoms. Tapeworm infections are usually treated with an oral medication, such as praziquantel (Biltricide), which paralyzes the adult tapeworm. The praziquantel (Biltricide) causes the tapeworms to detach from the gut, become dissolved, and then pass out of your body through your stool.

✨Common treatments for a roundworm infection include mebendazole (Vermox, Emverm) and albendazole (Albenza).

✨Symptoms typically begin to improve after a few weeks of treatment. Your doctor will most likely take and analyze another stool sample after treatment is complete to see if the worms have disappeared.

◽️Complications:
Intestinal worms increases risk for anemia and intestinal blockages.

✨Complications occur more frequently in older adults and in people who have suppressed immune systems, such as people with HIV or AIDS infection.

#WORM INFESTATION SUMMARY:

Worm infestations happen when worms affect the intestines and other parts of the body. Examples of the different worms are roundworms, whipworms, hookworms, tapeworms and flukes.

A patient with a mild infestation might not show any symptoms. However, some may experience itching around the anal area. The itch normally happens at night when the female worm lays eggs at the areas surrounding the anus. Other symptoms include

Poor appetite which can cause weight loss
Stomach discomfort, diarrhea, nausea
Poor sleep
Being unable to concentrate
Spotting worms in your stool during bowel movement  
A worm infestation spreads most commonly through passing of the worm eggs from the anus to the mouth. Worm eggs are often found under the fingernails of the infected person who has scratched the area around the anus. When the infected person uses their contaminated fingers to handle food and eat, the eggs are transferred directly from the anus to the mouth.

Eggs that fall off the areas surrounding the anus into the environment can also be breathed in. Eggs may also be spread by house dust, from pets or through contact with contaminated objects such as bedding, cups, utensils or doorknobs.

What you can do

Keep fingernails short to prevent the transfer of eggs to the fingernails and avoid biting nails. Cut and scrub the nails of infected persons with a brush and soap.  
 Practice good toilet hygiene such as washing your hands after visiting the toilet to reduce the transfer of worms from the anus to the mouth. Disinfect toilet seats regularly.
Wash hands before handling food and before meals.  
 Make sure your food is cooked properly. Drink safe and clean water.  
 Have daily morning showers to remove any eggs that were laid at the area around the anus.
Wash clothes and bedding with hot water for the whole family. Do not shake these items before you wash them as shaking the clothes or bedding can spread eggs into the air.  
 Clean the floor by vacuuming or mopping for a few days after being treated for the worm infestation
Family members who are in close contact with the infected person should also receive treatment. .
