# PHARMACEUTIC SUMMARY

PHARMACEUTICAL WEIGHING:

Every pharmaceutical manufacturing plant features an area in which raw materials are weighed and transferred to clean containers. This area goes by various names, including Weighing, Weighroom, Central Weigh, Pharmacy, Dispensary, Dispensing, Fractionation and Subdivision. No matter what it‚Äôs called, its design is essential. This article outlines some best practices for design, layout and operation of these areas.

üí•Three basic principles should drive the design of any pharmaceutical weighroom:

-Unidirectional flow of materials and personnel

-Segregation between hazardous and non-hazardous materials

-Separation of storage and manufacturing items and spaces.

In the past, convenience dictated the placement of weighrooms, traditionally located right near warehouses where materials were stored. Today, the weighroom is viewed as the entry point to manufacturing and the transition point for materials coming from the warehouse and entering process areas, so specific criteria will determine the best location.

Understanding what affects a measurement and implementing appropriate procedures will aid weighing accuracy.

One of the most crucial pieces of equipment being used in every pharmaceutical facility is the weighing equipment, which includes weighing scales and analytical balances. Every ingredient that is used for manufacturing a pharmaceutical product must be weighed accurately so that the recipe isn‚Äôt compromised, which would affect the quality of the end product. Here are some best weighing practices that every pharmaceutical company should implement.

Calculate measurement error
There are no ideal measurements in the pharmaceutical industry. Each measurement is afflicted by an error. The measured volume‚Äôs real value can never be defined absolutely due to imperfections of instruments and methods.

Performing quality risk management helps avoid the risk of weighing incorrectly. Have a complete understanding of the devices that are being used for weighing in the facility, and gather information on the measurement possibilities that need to be controlled and used in practice. Estimate the repeatability and the sensitivity of the balance to determine if it is operating properly or if there is some deviation.

Consider external factors;
Take into account all the external factors that the weighing balances are exposed to in a typical laboratory. External factors consist of all the factors that originate from the ambient area and people who influence the measurement result. Though it isn‚Äôt possible to define all the external factors, the main ones include:

Oscillations
Electrostatics
Air breeze
Vibrations
Magnetism
Temperature drifts
Evaporation and absorption phenomena (hygroscopicity).
These factors are capable of influencing both the balance as well as the object being weighed.

Conclusion:
Implementing best weighing practices assures high product quality and lowers the risk of analysis. Following these practices will help in attaining accurate weighing results

EMULSION:
Pharmaceutical emulsions are liquid disperse systems in which the dispersed phase is composed of small globules of a liquid distributed throughout a vehicle in which it is immiscible. In emulsion terminology, the dispersed phase is the discontinuous or internal phase, and the dispersion medium is the continuous or external phase.

üí•The diameter of the dispersed phase globules is generally in the range of about 0.1 to 10 Œºm, although it can be as small as 0.01 Œºm or as large as 100 Œºm. üí•Emulsions are thermodynamically unstable and are usually stabilized by the presence of an emulsifier. The process of formation of an emulsion is termed emulsification.

üí•Emulsified systems range from lotions of relatively low viscosity to ointments and creams, which are semisolid in nature. üí•Pharmaceutical emulsions are used for the administration of nutrients, drugs, and diagnostic agents. Topical creams and lotions are popular forms of emulsions for external use.

Types of emulsion
üí•Emulsions typically consist of a polar (e.g., aqueous) and a relatively nonpolar (e.g., an oil) liquid phase. The two basic types of emulsions are

üí•Oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion
üí•Water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion
However, depending upon the need, more complex systems referred to as ‚Äúdouble emulsions‚Äù or ‚Äúmultiple emulsions‚Äù can be made. These emulsions have an emulsion as the dispersed phase in a continuous phase and they can be either

üí•Water-in-oil-in-water (W1/O/W2) emulsion
üí•Oil-in-water-in-oil (O1/W/O2) emulsion.

By considering particle size, pharmaceutical emulsions can be

Macroemulsions (droplets size usually exceeds 10 mm)
Miniemulsions (droplets size usually 0.1‚Äì10 ¬µm)
Microemulsions (droplets size usually 100-600 nm)
Nanoemulsions (droplets size usually below 100 nm)
Emulsions can also be classified based on the mode of administration into

Oral emulsions e.g., castor oil, liquid paraffin
External emulsions e.g., creams
Parenteral emulsions e.g., vitamins
Rectal emulsions e.g., enema.

üí•Theories of Emulsions
Several theories have been proposed to explain the stability of emulsions. Some of the theories are related to the functional role of emulsifiers and others to processing conditions. The most important theories are the

üí•surface tension theory
oriented-wedge theory and
interfacial film theory
Manufacturing of Pharmaceutical emulsions
Emulsions may be prepared by using different methods, depending on the nature of the emulsion components and instrumentation available for use. On a small scale, as in the laboratory or pharmacy, emulsions may be prepared using equipment such as a porcelain mortar and pestle, mechanical blenders, and homogenizers.

In small-scale extemporaneous preparation of emulsions, four methods may be used:

continental, or dry gum, method
English, or wet gum, method
in situ soap method
mechanical method
On a large scale, injectable and ophthalmic emulsions are manufactured using the mechanical method in aseptic conditions.

The manufacture of an emulsion must be undertaken in a predictable and controlled manner, in order to obtain:
Uniformity of surface coverage.
Monodispersed droplet sizes in the population produced.
The smallest droplet size possible.
üí•Tests for identification of emulsion types
1.Dilution test
2.Dye test
3.Fluorescence test
4.Conductivity test
5.Cobalt chloride paper test
üí•Stability of pharmaceutical emulsions
Emulsions must demonstrate physical, chemical, and microbial stability throughout their shelf life under recommended packaging and storage conditions.

a. Physical instability
Physical stability of an emulsion is characterized by the maintenance of elegance with respect to appearance, odor, color, taste, opacity, and viscosity. Four major phenomena are associated with the physical instability of emulsions:

flocculation
creaming
coalescence
breaking
b. Chemical instability
The drug substance must be chemically stable in the dosage form throughout the shelf life of the product under recommended packaging and storage conditions in terms of both potency and impurities. The drug product must meet predetermined requirements of minimum potency of the drug substance and maximum levels of known and unknown impurities.

üí•Factors governing the reaction kinetics of the drug substance, such as the reactivity of functional groups and the kinetics of reactions are no different for emulsionemulsion dosage forms than other solution-based dosage forms. Nevertheless, separation of the reacting species in the oily and aqueous phases can minimize reactivity and improve stability of a drug in an emulsion.

c. Microbial growth
Microbial load of a dosage form must be controlled within the compendial and the regulatory levels. In addition to the health risks of microbial growth, microorganisms in an emulsion can cause physical separation of the phases.

Preservatives must be added in adequate concentrations in the formulations to resist microbial growth. The preservative should be concentrated in the aqueous phase because bacterial growth will normally occur there. The oil and water partition coefficient of the preservatives should be considered to calculate the concentration of the surfactant in the aqueous phase, which needs to be above the antimicrobial concentration.

The parabens (methylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben) are the commonly used preservatives in emulsions.

üí•Pharmaceutical application of emulsions(take note of this Please)

Emulsions (macroemulsions and microemulsions) are generally well documented as carriers for hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs.
Oils and drugs having objectionable taste or texture can be made more palatable for oral administration by formulating into emulsions. As a result, mineral oil-based laxatives, oil-soluble vitamins, vegetable oils, high-fat nutritive preparations for enteral feeding, and certain drugs such as valproic acid are formulated frequently in an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion form.
With topically applied emulsions, the formulation scientist can control the viscosity, appearance, and degree of greasiness of cosmetic and dermatologic products. o/w emulsions are most useful as water-washable bases, whereas water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions are used widely for the treatment of dry skin and emollient applications to provide an occlusive effect.
Semisolid preparations, such as ointments and creams, represent the dispersions of liquids in solids, which are used topically.
Emulsions are also employed in many other clinical applications as radiopaque emulsions and parenteral emulsions and in blood replacement therapy.
