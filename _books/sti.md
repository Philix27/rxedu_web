# Pharmacotherapy of Sexually Transmitted Infections:

DAY 3 SUMMARY (II)

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are also commonly called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). They are the infections you get from another person through sexual contact. According to the CDC, there are more than 20 known types of STDs/STIs. In addition, over 20 million people in the United States are infected each year. About half of these people are age 15-24. Luckily, most STDs can be treated and cured.

Symptoms:

Often, there are no symptoms at all.
‚ú®Men may experience the following symptoms:

Burning or itching in the penis

A drip (discharge) from the penis

Pain around pelvis

Sores, bumps or blisters on penis, anus, or mouth

Burning and pain with urine or with bowel movements

Having to go to the bathroom often

‚ú®Women may experience the following symptoms:

Burning or itching in the vagina

A discharge or odor from the vagina

Pain around the pelvis

Bleeding from the vagina that is not normal

Pain deep inside during sex

Sores, bumps or blisters in the vagina, anus, or mouth

Burning and pain with urine or with bowel movements

Having to go to the bathroom often

‚ú®Aetiology:
What causes STDs?

Bacteria and viruses that grow in warm, moist places in the body cause STDs. They are passed from one person to another through sex. Infections can spread from the penis, vagina, mouth or anus. These infections can be minor or they can be very painful, even life threatening.

‚ú®How do sexually transmitted infections spread?

They are spread through fluids in the body. Most often shared during vaginal, oral or anal sex. Some STDs pass from one person to another through infected blood. For example, among people who share infected drug needles. Or a mother may infect her child during pregnancy, childbirth or nursing.

STDs are not spread through casual contact. Shaking hands, sharing clothes, or sharing a toilet seat, for example, would not lead to STDs.

‚ú®TakenoteüëÜ

‚ú®Who is at risk?

Anyone can get a STD. Teenagers and young adults have the highest risk. They are more likely to have many sex partners, and they may not know how to prevent problems. Street-drug users who use dirty needles are also at risk.

‚ú®Diagnosis:
A health care professional can diagnose STIs. They will ask personal questions about your sex history. It‚Äôs important to be honest so you can get help. They may take a sample of fluid from the vagina or penis, or a blood test to confirm the problem. Laboratory tests can show what, if any, bacterial or viral STIs are present.

‚ö°Ô∏èBlood tests¬†can show if you have a disease that infects the blood.

‚ö°Ô∏èUrine samples¬†can show if you have a bacteria in your urine from an STI.

‚ö°Ô∏èFluid samples can show if you have active sores and help diagnose the type of infection.

Please Take note

‚ú®Types of STD

Chlamydia

Gonorrhea

Syphilis

Genital Herpes

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

Hepatitis B (HBV)

Genital Warts (HPV)

Trichomoniasis

‚ú®Chlamydia

This is the most common bacterial STI in the United States. An estimated 1.4 million new cases are diagnosed each year. It is transmitted through unprotected vaginal and anal sex.

Sometimes people have no sign that they have this disease. A man with chlamydia may feel pain when urinating or see fluid drip from the penis. A woman may bleed between periods, feel pain when urinating, see a discharge or feel mild pain in the lower belly. From anal sex, a patient may have anal bleeding or pain

Treatment:
‚Ä¢azithromycin ‚Äì given as 2 or 4 tablets at once

‚Ä¢doxycycline ‚Äì given as 2 capsules a day for a week

Gonorrhea;
Gonorrhea can cause infections in the genitals, rectum, and throat. Young people, age 15-24, are most often affected. You can get it by having unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the disease.

It may show no symptoms. Or, a person may find a discharge from the penis or vagina, and feel pain when urinating.

Gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics. If untreated, it can cause serious damage to a woman's reproductive system. It can make it difficult or impossible to get pregnant. In men, if this is left untreated it may cause¬†urethral stricture.

‚ú®Syphilis

This is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection from vaginal, anal or oral sex. It can spread if the sores caused by syphilis touch the skin of a healthy person. Sores can be found on the penis, vagina, anus, in the rectum, or on the lips and mouth. Syphilis can also spread from an infected mother to her unborn baby.

Usually, the first symptom is a painless open sore. Sores can form on your genitals, or the palms of your hands and soles of your feet. The second stage rash can look like rough, red or reddish brown spots.

Penicillin is a successful treatment. If syphilis is not treated, it can remain in the body for years. It can cause serious problems including paralysis (unable to move body parts), mental disorders, damage to organs and even death.

‚ú®Genital Herpes

This infection is very common. One in six people (age 14-49) has genital herpes. Many people don‚Äôt know they have it. This infection, caused by two viruses, Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2).

The Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) is mostly spread by nonsexual contact but it can spread with oral sex. HSV-1 usually causes sores on the lips.

The Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2) spreads when fluid from the infection touches a partner, often during sex. Genital blisters from HSV-2 may not be seen.

Blisters can form, break, cause pain and take weeks to heal. There is no known cure for HSV but symptoms can be treated with antiviral medicine.

‚ú®Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS results from an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is not curable, and potentially deadly. It attacks the body's immune system.

Only blood, semen (¬†cum), pre-seminal fluid (¬†pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk carry the virus. Infected needles or other sharp tools can spread AIDS as well. An infected mother can give her baby the virus during pregnancy, childbirth or nursing.

Some people have no signs if they get it. Others may feel like they have a bad flu for a long time. The virus can go un-noticed for many years. If you think you‚Äôve been in contact with an infected person, you should get tested.

Antiviral, HIV medicines are available to improve the life and health of an infected person.

‚ú®Hepatitis B (HBV)

This STI is a serious virus that attacks the liver. Effective vaccines since the 1990s have helped to prevent this infection. There are fewer cases every year. Blood, semen and body fluids shared during sex can spread the virus. Many people are born with the disease from their infected mother. Getting care to people with long-term HBV is important but often people have no clear symptoms.

When symptoms are present, they can include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, poor appetite, vomiting and diarrhea. Since HBV attacks liver cells, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure and possibly death. Dark urine, abdominal pain and yellowing of the skin or eyes are signs of liver damage.

There is no known cure for hepatitis B. Still, medications to treat chronic infection will help. Vaccine is the best protection. Acute HBV has no treatment. Chronic HBV is treated with antiviral medicines, interferon treatment, or a liver transplant. Vaccine is the best prevention.

‚ú®Genital Warts

These warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is the most common viral STI the United States. It is spread through vaginal or anal sex. It can be passed even when an infected person has no symptoms.

The warts that develop are painless, fleshy, cauliflower-looking bumps. They grow on the penis or in and around the entrance of the vagina or anus. HPV may eventually cause cervical cancer.

Fortunately, there is a successful vaccine to prevent HPV and genital warts. The vaccine is given to children age 11 or 12, or for people age 20-26. There is no known cure for genital warts. However, they can be treated with topical ointments. Sometimes they can be removed with minor surgical procedures (e.g., cautery (freezing or burning off the wart), chemicals, or laser). Vaccine is the best prevention.

‚ú®Trichomoniasis

This STI results from a parasite. It is spread through sexual contact from the penis or vagina. It mainly affects young, sexually active women. Uncircumcised men are found to spread the infection more. Only about 30% of people with this STI have symptoms.

Men with this STI may feel itching or irritation inside the penis. They may see discharge or feel burning after urination or ejaculation. Women may notice itching, burning, redness or soreness, discomfort with urination. Or, they may have an unusual discharge with a bad smell. Having trichomoniasis can make it feel unpleasant to have sex.

Without treatment, the infection can last for months or even years. Women with it may deliver underweight babies. Trichomoniasis can be easily treated with antibiotics.

Chlamydia :

Chlamydia trachomatis
is very similar to and can co-exist with gonorrhea
Signs and symptoms include:

vaginal discharge or abdominal pain
pain upon urination
urinary frequency and urgency
Eye damage or pneumonia in newborns
Routine treatment of newborns

Syphilis

Treponema pallidum
Causative organism called a Spirochete

Forms a chancre
There are three stages of syphilis:
‚Ä¢Early stage
‚Ä¢Secondary syphilis stage
‚Ä¢Tertiary syphilis
‚àöAn inactive (latent) stage.
Neurosyphilis

Genital herpes:
Caused by herpes simplex virus
(HSV):
It is transmitted through intimate contact with the mucous-covered
linings of the mouth, vagina, the
genital skin.
When an infected person has a
herpes outbreak;
Typical redness and blisters
occur.
Subsequent outbreaks then to be sporadic.

Genital warts:

Caused by Human papilloma
virus More than 40 types of HPV,
Some HPVs cause common warts that are not stds
HPV infection has long been known to be a cause of cervical
cancer and other anogenital cancers in women,
It has also been linked with both anal and penile cancer in men.
HPV infection is common and does not usually lead to the
development of warts, cancers, or specific symptoms.

Chancroid;

caused by the bacteriumHemophilus
ducreyi
It starts out as a tender bump that emerges 3 to10 days (the incubation
period) The cells that form the bump then begin to die,
And the bump becomes an ulcer (an open sore)
Often, there is an associated
tenderness and swelling of the glands (lymph nodes) in the groin that normally
drain lymph from the genital area;

Trichomoniasis:

caused by the Trichomonas vaginalis parasite.
Most women and men who are infected do not have symptoms
When the infection does cause symptoms, it typically results in
urethritis;
with itching or burning and discharge from the urethra.
Vaginal bleeding or spotting
Vaginal discharge
Genital redness and swelling

Candidiasis

Is a fungal infection caused by yeasts that belong to the genus
Candida.

There are over 20 species of Candida yeasts that can cause infection in humans,
The most common of which is candida albicans

Candida balanitis is common in men , Candidiasis affecting reproductive tract of women is called vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)
Candida cystitis is common in the urinary tract

DIAGNOSIS

Diagnosis of gonorrhea:
‚Ä¢swabbing the infected site (rectum, throat, cervix) for bacterial culture
‚Ä¢DNA probes Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Diagnosis of syphilis
is complicated by the fact that the causative organism cannot be grown in the lab.
Therefore, cultures of affected areas cannot be used for
diagnosis.
Special blood tests can also be used to diagnose syphilis.
The standard screening blood tests for syphilis are called:
‚Ä¢The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)
‚Ä¢Rapid Plasminogen Reagent (RPR) tests.

Diagnosis of herpes:

‚Ä¢Blood tests:
Tests are specific for HSV-1 or
HSV-2
May give a false positive result
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
identify the genetic material of the virus
‚Ä¢Rapid fluorescent antibody
screening tests

Diagnosis of HPV:
‚Ä¢Pap smear
‚Ä¢Biopsy of a genital wart

Diagnosis of chancroid:
Can be done using medical history and physical examination
if the patient has one or more painful ulcers in the genital area
Note that:
Chancroid ulcer is a soft chancre while the chancre of syphilis feels hard
to the touch.
‚Ä¢The ulcer of chancroid also is painful, unlike the ulcer of syphilis that is
painless.
‚Ä¢Bacteria culture can also be done

Diagnosis of Trichomoniasis
‚Ä¢cell cultures
antigen tests that look for
Trichomonas DNA
‚Ä¢examining samples of vaginal fluid
(for women) or urethral discharge
(for men) under a microscope

Diagnosis of candidiasis:
‚Ä¢Urine fungal culture
‚Ä¢Urinalysis

GOAL OF THERAPY:

‚Ä¢To cure or manage infectious diseases(where applicable)

‚Ä¢To resolve clinical symptoms

‚Ä¢To prevent or reduce transmission to others

‚Ä¢To educate patients on their disease, and its prevention

‚Ä¢To prevent/ reduce resistance to antimicrobials

‚Ä¢To promote safer sex behaviour

‚Ä¢To identify barriers to adherence.

Pharmaceutical care considerations:

‚Ä¢Drug selection
Criteria for the selection of STI drugs include:
high efficacy (at least 95%)
low cost
acceptable toxicity and tolerance
Adherence
organism resistance unlikely to develop or likely to be delayed
single dose
Route of administration
not contraindicated for pregnant or lactating women.
Formulation type

Prevention And Control Of STDs

‚Ä¢Primary prevention
‚Ä¢Abstinence
‚Ä¢Mutually faithful sexual relationship
‚Ä¢Correct and consistent use of condoms
‚Ä¢Safer sex practices
‚Ä¢Secondary prevention
‚Ä¢Promoting STI care-seeking behaviour through:
‚Ä¢Providing non-stigmatizing and non-discriminatory health services
‚Ä¢Providing quality STls care
‚Ä¢Providing correct antimicrobial therapy for the STls syndrome

Prognosis:

Most STDs are curable if diagnosed early and properly treated Viral STDs cannot be cured but can be suppressed
Important to treat partner(s) to prevent re-infection of the
disease,
Also some patients may have developed complications as a
result of an STD even after the infection may have been treated.

Conclusion:

In summary, several diseases can be transmitted via sexual contact And like the saying goes ‚Äúprevention is better than cure ‚Äù or in this case treatment as not all STDs can be cured; also considering the many complications linked to these diseases It is therefore of high importance for safe sex to be practiced;
abstinence remains a better option for the unmarried.
Also patients need to know the importance of treating their partners to avoid reinfection‚Ä¶
