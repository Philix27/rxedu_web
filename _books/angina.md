# PHARMACOTHERAPY OF ANGINA PECTORIS

## Introduction

You may have heard the term “angina pectoris” or “stable angina” in your doctor’s office, but what is it, and what could it mean for you? It’s important to understand the basics.

Angina pectoris is the medical term for chest pain or discomfort due to coronary heart disease.  It occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get as much blood as it needs. This usually happens because one or more of the heart's arteries is narrowed or blocked, also called ischemia.

Angina usually causes uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing or pain in the center of the chest.  You may also feel the discomfort in your neck, jaw, shoulder, back or arm.  (Many types of chest discomfort — like heartburn, lung infection or inflammation — aren‘t related to angina.).

### What Are the symptoms of Angina Pectoris?

Symptoms of Angina

- The pain or discomfort: Occurs when the heart must work harder, usually during - physical exertion
- Doesn't come as a surprise, and episodes of pain tend to be alike
- Usually lasts a short time (5 minutes or less).
- Is relieved by rest or medicine.
- May feel like gas or indigestion
- May feel like chest pain that spreads to the arms, back, - or other areas

### Triggers of Angina Pectoris!

Possible triggers of angina include:

- Emotional stress – learn stress management

- Exposure to very hot or cold temperatures – learn - how cold and hot weather affect the heart.
- Heavy meals
- Smoking – learn more about quitting smoking.

### Forms of Angina

1. **Stable angina:** This is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one.

2. **Unstable angina:** You can have this while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and it may come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.

3. **Microvascular angina** With this type, you have chest pain but no coronary artery blockage. Instead, it happens because your smallest coronary arteries aren’t working the way they should, so your heart doesn’t get the blood it needs. The chest pain usually lasts more than 10 minutes. This type is more common in women.

4. **Prinzmetal's angina (variant angina):** This type is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. Your heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.

### Less common causes of chest pain include:

- A blockage in a major artery of your lungs (pulmonary embolism)

- An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)

- Narrowing of a valve in the main part of your heart (aortic stenosis)

- Swelling of the sac around your heart (pericarditis)

- Tearing in the wall of your aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)

### Risk Factor's to Angina Pectoris?

Some things about you or your lifestyle could put you at higher risk of angina, including:

- Older age

- Family history of heart disease

- High blood pressure

- High cholesterol

- Diabetes

- Obesity

- Stress

- Using tobacco

- Not getting enough exercise

### DIAGNOSIS:

Tests including:

1. EKG. This test measures your heart’s electrical activity and rhythm.

2. Stress test. This checks how your heart is working while you exercise.

3. Blood tests: Your doctor will check for proteins called troponins. Lots of them are released when your heart muscle is damaged, as in a heart attack. Your doctor may also do more general tests like a metabolic panel or complete blood count (CBC).

4. IMAGING tests: Chest X-rays can rule out other things that might be causing your chest pain, like lung conditions. Echocardiograms and CT and MRI scans can create images of your heart to help your doctor spot problems.

5. CARDIAC catheterization: Your doctor inserts a long, thin tube into an artery in your leg and threads it up to your heart to check your blood flow and pressure.

6. CORONARY angiography: Your doctor injects dye into the blood vessels of your heart. The dye shows up on an X-ray, creating an image of your blood vessels. They may do this procedure during cardiac catheterization.

### Pharmacotherapy:

- Nitrates or calcium channel blockers to relax and widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to your heart

- Beta-blockers to slow your heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard

- Blood thinners or antiplatelet medications to prevent blood clots

- Statins to lower your cholesterol levels and stabilize plaque

### Non Pharmacologic:

- Cardiac procedures: If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be:

- Angioplasty/stenting. The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, they inflate the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. They may insert a small tube called a stent inside your artery to help keep it open. The stent is permanent and usually made of metal. It can also be made of a material that your body absorbs over time. Some stents also have medicine that helps keep your artery from getting blocked again. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You’ll probably stay overnight at the hospital.

- Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or bypass surgery. Your surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels.

You can expect to stay in the hospital about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for a day or two while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You'll then move to a regular room to recover.

### Lifestyle changes

You can still be active, but it's important to listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop what you’re doing and rest. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. Try to avoid things that tend to set it off. For example, if large meals cause problems, eat smaller ones and eat more often. If you still feel pain, talk to your doctor about having more tests or changing your medications. Because angina can be a sign of something dangerous, it’s important to get checked out.

These lifestyle tips may help protect your heart:

If you smoke, stop. It can damage your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk.

Eat a heart-healthy diet to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Eat mainly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, and fat-free or low-fat dairy. Limit salt, fat, and sugar.
