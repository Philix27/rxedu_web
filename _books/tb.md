# Pharmacotherapy of TB:

‚Ä¢ Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important disease both
globally & in Malaysia.
‚Ä¢ TB is a disease caused by mycobacteria.
‚Ä¢ Number of TB cases in the country continues to
increase.
‚Ä¢ High rates of morbidity & mortality due to:
ÔÉ†Delayed presentation
ÔÉ†Advanced HIV

Close TB contacts.

High risk Groups:(\*take note)

‚Ä¢ Immunocompromised patients:

- Diabetes mellitus
- HIV
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- End-stage renal disease
- Malignancy
- Malnutrition
  ‚Ä¢ Substance abusers & cigarette smokers
  ‚Ä¢ Poor people living in overcrowded conditions

How is TB managed?

MANAGEMENT OF PULMONARY  
TUBERCULOSIS (PTB) IN ADULTS:

A.6-month regimen consisting of 2 months of EHRZ (2EHRZ) followed by 4 months of HR (4HR) is recommended for newly-diagnosed
PTB.

Pyridoxine 10 - 50 mg daily needs to be added if isoniazid
is prescribed.
‚Ä¢ Daily treatment is the preferred regimen.

Please take note of the aboveüëÜ

ROLE OF 1ST LINE
ANTITUBERCULOSIS:
ÔÅ± Isoniazid : gives a better cure rate
ÔÅ± Rifampicin : sterilises throughout treatment
ÔÅ± Pyrazinamide : Sterilises during the first 2 mth
ÔÅ±Ethambutol & Streptomycin : SM probably has slight sterilising activity, while EMB has none. Both probably need to be given only for the first 2 months, once the bacteria are in dormant form, the
drugs are not necessary.

Pyrazinamide :
The addition of PZA to an RMP-containing initial
phase increases sterilising action as shown by an increase in the proportion of negative 2-month
cultures and/or a reduction in the relapse rate.

‚ú®Tuberculosis Transmission:

When someone who has TB¬†coughs, sneezes, talks, laughs, or sings, they release tiny droplets that contain the germs. If you¬†breathe¬†in these germs, you can get it.

TB isn‚Äôt easy to catch. You usually have to spend a long time around someone who has a lot of the bacteria in their lungs.¬†You‚Äôre most likely to catch it from co-workers, friends, and family members.

Tuberculosis germs don‚Äôt thrive on surfaces. You can‚Äôt get it from shaking hands with someone who has it or by sharing their food or drink.

‚ú®Tuberculosis Tests and Diagnosis:

There are two common tests for tuberculosis:

Skin test.¬†This is also known as the Mantoux tuberculin skin test. A technician injects a small amount of fluid into the skin of your lower arm. After 2 or 3 days, they‚Äôll check for swelling in your arm. If your results are positive, you probably have TB bacteria. But you could also get a false positive. If you‚Äôve gotten a tuberculosis vaccine called bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the test could say that you have TB when you really don‚Äôt. The results can also be false negative, saying that you don‚Äôt have TB when you really do, if you have a very new infection. You might get this test more than once.

Blood test.¬†These tests, also called interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), measure the response when TB proteins are mixed with a small amount of your blood.

Those tests don‚Äôt tell you if your infection is latent or active. If you get a positive skin or blood test, your doctor will learn which type you have with:

A chest X-ray or CT scan to look for changes in your lungs

Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) tests for TB bacteria in your sputum, the mucus that comes up when you cough

‚ú®Tuberculosis Prevention

To help stop the spread of TB:

If you have a latent infection, take all of your medication so it doesn‚Äôt become active and contagious.

If you have active TB, limit your contact with other people. Cover your mouth when you laugh, sneeze, or cough. Wear a surgical mask when you‚Äôre around other people during the first weeks of treatment.

If you‚Äôre traveling to a place where TB is common, avoid spending a lot of time in crowded places with sick people.

Now let's talk properly about the Drug therapy for Tuberculosis:üëåüîä

‚ú®Tuberculosis Treatment:

Your treatment will depend on your infection.

If you have¬†latent TB, your doctor will give you medication to kill the bacteria so the infection doesn‚Äôt become active. You might get isoniazid, rifapentine, or rifampin, either alone or combined. You‚Äôll have to take the drugs for up to 9 months. If you see any signs of active TB, call your doctor right away.

A combination of medicines also treats¬†active TB. The most common are ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. You‚Äôll take them for 6 to 12 months.

If you have¬†drug-resistant TB, your doctor might give you one or more different medicines. You may have to take them for much longer, up to 30 months, and they can cause more side effects.

Whatever kind of infection you have, it‚Äôs important to finish taking all of your medications, even when you feel better. If you quit too soon, the bacteria can become resistant to the drugs.

Please take note‚ñ™Ô∏è

‚ú®First-line antituberculosis drugs- ‚Ä¢Isoniazid (INH),
‚Ä¢ rifampicin (RIF),
‚Ä¢ ethambutol (EMB),
‚Ä¢ pyrazinamide (PZA) and ‚Ä¢streptomycin (SM).

‚ú®Second-line antituberculosis drugs- Sub divided into two;

‚Ä¢Fluoroquinolones- Ofloxacin (OFX), levofloxacin (LEV), moxifloxacin (MOX) and ciprofloxacin (CIP).

‚Ä¢Injectable antituberculosis drugs- Kanamycin (KAN), amikacin (AMK) and capreomycin (CAP).

‚ú®Less-effective second-line antituberculosis drugs:-
‚Ä¢Ethionamide (ETH)/Prothionamide (PTH),
‚Ä¢Cycloserine (CS)/Terizidone, ‚Ä¢P-aminosalicylic acid (PAS).

Isoniazid

Isoniazid (INH) is one of the most effective and specific antituberculosis drugs, which has been a key to treatment since its introduction in 1952 .¬†M. tuberculosis¬†is highly susceptible to INH (MIC 0.02‚Äì0.2 Œºg/ml). INH is only active against growing tubercle bacilli, and is not active against non-replicating bacilli or under anaerobic conditions. INH enters the mycobacterial cell by passive diffusion .
‚ú®The most significant adverse reactions associated with isoniazid administration are 1.hepatotoxicity and 2.neurotoxicity.

Take note of the side effects

2.Rifampicin (RIF) was introduced in 1972 as an antituberculosis drug and has excellent sterilizing activity. Rifampicin acts by binding to the Œ≤-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) , the enzyme responsible for transcription and expression of mycobacterial genes, resulting in inhibition of the bacterial transcription activity and thereby killing the organism. An important characteristic of rifampicin is that it is active against actively growing and slowly metabolizing (non-growing) bacilli .RIF produces relatively few adverse reactions.
‚ú®It may cause gastrointestinal upset. Hepatotoxicity occurs less frequently than with isoniazid administration.

3.Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an important first-line antituberculosis (anti-TB) drug that is used in short-course chemotherapy and is one of the cornerstone drugs in the treatment of MDR-TB . One key characteristic of pyrazinamide is its ability to inhibit semidormant bacilli residing in acidic environments . Pyrazinamide is a structural analogue of nicotinamide and is a pro-drug that needs to be converted into its active form, pyrazinoic acid, by the enzyme pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase (PZase). PZA is only active against¬†M. tuberculosis¬†at acid pH (e.g., 5.5) . Even at acid pH (5.5), PZA activity is quite poor, with MICs in the range of 6.25‚Äì50 Œºg/ml. ‚ú®Hypersensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal upset may occur with PZA administration.

Ethambutol

Ethambutol (EMB) [dextro-2,2‚Äô-(ethylenediimino)di-1-butanol], which is an essential first-line drug in tuberculosis treatment, plays an important role in the chemotherapy of drug-resistant TB. EMB is also an important antimycobacterial drug as it enhances the effect of other companion drugs including aminoglycosides, rifamycins and quinolones.

‚ú® The most common side effects observed with ethambutol are dizziness, blurred vision, color blindness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, headache, rash, itching, breathlessness, swelling of the face, lips or eyes, numbness or tingling in the fingers or toes. Patients taking ethambutol should have their visual acuity and color vision checked at least monthly.

5.Streptomycin

Streptomycin (SM), an aminocyclitol glycoside antibiotic, was the first drug to be used in the treatment of TB, in 1948. SM kills actively growing tubercle bacilli with MICs of 2‚Äì4 Œºg/ml, but it is inactive against non-growing or intracellular bacilli. The drug binds to the 16S rRNA, interferes with translation proofreading, and thereby inhibits protein synthesis.

‚ú® Ototoxicity and nephotoxicity are associated with SM administration. Vestibular dysfunction is more common than auditory damage. Renal toxicity occurs less frequently than with kanamycin or capreomycin. Hearing and renal function should be monitored in patients getting SM

Second-line antituberculosis drugs

‚ñ´Ô∏è Fluoroquinolones

The fluoroquinolones (FQs) have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and so are widely used for the treatment of bacterial infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, as well as sexually transmitted diseases and chronic osteomyelitis. In contrast to many other antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections, the FQs have excellent in vitro and in vivo activity against¬†M. tuberculosis. FQs include ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. So, FQs are currently in use as second-line drugs in the treatment of TB.

‚ú®Adverse effects are relatively infrequent (0.5‚Äì10% of patients) and include gastrointestinal intolerance, rashes, dizziness, and headache. Most studies of fluoroquinolone side effects have been based on relatively short-term administration for bacterial infections, but trials have now shown the relative safety and tolerability of fluoroquinolones administered for months during TB treatment in adults.

2.Aminoglycosides (kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin)

The aminoglycosides amikacin (AMK)/kanamycin (KAN) and the cyclic polypeptide capreomycin (CAP) are important injectable drugs in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Although belonging to two different antibiotic families, all exert their activity at the level of protein translation.

‚ú®Renal toxicity occurs from these drugs. Regular monitoring of hearing and renal function is recommended.

3.Ethionamide/prothionamide

Ethionamide (ETH, 2-ethylisonicotinamide) is a derivative of isonicotinic acid and has been used as an antituberculosis agent since 1956. The MICs of ETH for¬†M. tuberculosis¬†are 0.5‚Äì2 Œºg/ml in liquid medium, 2.5‚Äì10 Œºg/ml in 7H11 agar, and 5‚Äì20 Œºg/ml in LJ medium. Ethionamide and the similar drug prothionamide (PTH, 2-ethyl-4-pyridinecarbothioamide) act as pro-drugs, like isoniazid. Which is activated by EtaA/EthA (a mono-oxygenase) and inhibits the same target as INH, the InhA of the mycolic acid synthesis pathway . Once delivered into the bacterial cell, ethionamide undergoes several changes. Its sulfo group is oxidized by flavin monooxygenase, and the drug is then converted to 2-ethyl-4-aminopyridine. The intermediate products formed before 2-ethyl-4-aminopyridine seem to be toxic to mycobacteria, but their structures are unknown (may be highly unstable compounds). Mutants resistant to ethionamide are cross-resistant to prothionamide.

‚ú® ETH frequently causes gastrointestinal side effects, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and anorexia. It can cause hypothyroidism, particularly if it is used with¬†para-aminosalicyclic acid.

5.p-Amino salicylic acid (PAS) was one of the first antibiotics to show anti-TB activity and was used to treat TB in combination with isoniazid and streptomycin [93]. Later, with the discovery of other more potent drugs including rifampicin, its use in first line regimens was discontinued. PAS is still useful as part of a treatment regimen for XDR TB although its benefit is limited and it is extremely toxic. Thymidylate synthase A, encoded by¬†thyA, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of thymine, has been proposed recently as the target of PAS in¬†M. bovis¬†BCG . Most common mutation in¬†thyA¬†was Thr202Ala, though few susceptible isolates also showed the same mutation . However, its mechanism of action was never clearly elucidated.

‚ú®The most common adverse reactions associated with PAS are gastrointestinal disturbances

Cycloserine (CS) is an antibiotic that is used to treat TB. The exact mechanism of action of cycloserine is unknown, but it is thought to prevent the tuberculosis bacteria from making substances called peptidoglycans, which are needed to form the bacterial cell wall. This results in the weakening of bacteria‚Äôs cell wall, which then kills the bacteria.
‚ú®Cycloserine possesses high gastric tolerance (compared with the other drugs) and lacks cross-resistance to other compounds. But it causes adverse psychiatric effects

‚ú®Conclusion :
Despite all the advances made in the treatment and management, TB still remains as one of the main public health problems that have plagued mankind for millennia. The challenges posed by¬†M. tuberculosis¬†infection, through its interaction with the immune system and its mechanisms for evasion, require many more breakthroughs to make a significant impact on the worldwide tuberculosis problem. The introduction of MDR and XDR strains of¬†M. tuberculosis¬†poses several problems in mycobacterial genetics and phthisiotherapy. Among the response priorities, rapid detection of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance, use of appropriate regimens for treatment, and new drug development are of paramount importance. However, regarding the dynamics of TB transmission, and also in view of rational development of new anti-TB drugs, it is extremely important to extend our knowledge on the molecular basis of drug resistance and all its complexity. It is necessary to clarify the association between specific mutations and the development of MDR-TB or the association between drug resistance and fitness. This would allow better evaluation of the transmission dynamics of resistant strains and more accurate prediction of a future disease scenario. Adequate monitoring of drug resistance, especially MDR/XDR-TB in new patients and its transmission, molecular characterization of the drug-resistant strains, and analysis of patients‚Äô immune status and genetic susceptibility are also needed to address the problem of the fitness, virulence and transmissibility of drug-resistant¬†M. tuberculosis¬†strains.
