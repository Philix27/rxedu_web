IMMUNIZATION & VACCINATION

_Definition_
Immunization is the process or routine whereby a person is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease ,typically by the administration of _vaccine_.

_Vaccination:_.
Is the treatment with a vaccine to produce immunity against a disease.

It entails the administration of antigenic material (weak or attenuated organisms) to stimulate an individuals immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen

Generally, immunization means acquiring immunity against disease, .

Note: successful vaccinations results in immunization

: _Types of immunity_

We have,

Active immunity
(Natural &or artificial)

Passive immunity
(Natural or/& artificial)

_Active immunity_

Is the process of exposing the body to an antigen to generate an adaptive immune response.the response takes time to develop

Natural immunity occurs from surviving an infection.

Artificial occurs via vaccination...

_Passive immunity:_
Is the process of providing antibodies to protect against infection.
It gives immediate ,but short-lived protection. Several weeks to months.

Natural occurs for the transfer of antibodies from mother to child(MTC)

Artificial occurs from immunoglobulin injection

_Immunizing agents_

There are 3main immunizing agents namely,

- Vaccines
  -Immunoglobulin
  -Antisera

_Vaccines:_

These are substances used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases prepared from the causative agents.

_Components of. Vaccine includes_.
Adjuvants
Preservatives
And additives

_Forms of vaccines_

Vaccines may be ;

- live vaccines e.g(BCG,MMR,OPV)

-inactivated vaccines e.g(iPV,HepB)

-Toxoids(Diphtheria, and tetanus)

_Immunoglobulin_

An immunoglobulin is. A protein produced By the plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralise pathogens.

_Immunoglobulins are for passive immunization_.

-Major classes:

Immunoglobulin I,M,A

example of immunoglobulin preparation is the, _Rabies immunoglobulin_

_Antisera_..

These are antibodies obtained from animal source which is used to provide immunity to a disease.

Example is ;.
Tetanus (ATS)
Diphtheria
Snake antivenoms

_Categories of immunization:_..

Childhood immunization:
E.g,OPV, HepB,BCG, pentaV ,measles, yellow fever,MMR, chicken pox,IPV,vitamin A,rotavirus PCv

Adult immunization:
Meningitis, typhoid chickenpox, MMR,tetanus,yellow fevr,hep B,HPV

Travel immunization:
HepB,HepA,meningitis,Polio,Rabies,yellow fever,typhoid.

_Kindly note the Pentavalent vaccines_

It contains five vaccines, namely;
Heamophilus influenza, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and Hep B vaccine.

It is administered via _IM_

Tetanus is used in wound management, also it can be administered with ATS at the same time with separate syringes at different sites.

_Precautions in immunization_

-observe recipients for allergic reactions 30mins after vaccination

-Adrenaline injection must be available in case of any acute anaphylactic reaction.

-Supportive measures such as O2 inhalation should also be available.

-Special care should be taken to ensure the injection dose not enter the blood vessels

_Role of pharmacists in immunization_

Provision of immunization site

Provision of immunization information

Ensure viability of vaccine

Patient screening

Ensure appropriate transportation and storage of vaccine

Immunological drug interaction must be ascertained..

Dispose off injectables

And Documentation

_VACCINE STORAGE:_

cold chain:
A system of storage and transfer of vaccines at low temperature from the manufacturer to the actual site .

Freezer vaccines (vaccines that must be in the freezer):

-OPV
-Varicella zoster vaccine (Varilix)

Non-Freezer vaccines:
Tetanus,BCG

_Cold Chain equipments_

-Cold rooms
-Cold boxes
-Ice packs
-Refrigerator
-Vaccine carrier

_Vaccine Vial Monitor:_

-it is a heat sensitive label put on vials containing vaccine which gives visual indication of whether the vaccine has been kept at a required temperature.

VVM is a circle with a small square which is printed on a label,attached to the cap of vial or neck.

This technique was designed in response to problem of delivering vaccines where cold chain is difficult to maintain

Finally;

Live vaccines must be stored in a freezer at -15Â°c or colder until administration

Inactivated vaccines are stored in the refrigerator at 2Â°c to 8Â°c

HPV, MMR, are sensitive to light hence stored in dark containers

Vaccines should not be stored in refrigerator door.

Vaccines should be stored in well labelled containers.

.it should be arranged according to the expiration date (FIFO)

The door must be closed at all times.
