# Logistic Management:-

## Purpose of conducting logistics assessment:

Assess the entire system's strengths and weaknesses
Present the results of yourassessment to managers and policymakers
Present your recommendations for eliminating
weaknesses
Propose an implementation Plan based on the
recommendations

#💯Reason for conducting logistics
assessment

-SC assessments are carried out for a number of reasons:

+Determining whether the commodity needs of a new program can be met reliably Identifying logistics problems related to product category Tracking logistics performance over the course of a
program
Improving supply chain performance and, ultimately
customer service

♟️Take note of this:
Examples of tool to assess logistics
Systems:

1.Logistics System Assessment tool (LSAT) 2. Logistics Indicator Assessment Tool (LIAT) 6. LIAT ART 7. LIAT HIV Test 3. Strategic Pathway to Reproductive Health Survey
(SPARHCS) 4. Tools to assess readiness 5. Assessment Tool for Lab Services (ATLAS)

# Introduction to Health Commodities Supply Chain;-

Commodity Security (RH) -

Reproductive health
commodity security exists when every person is able to choose,
obtain, and use quality contraceptives and other essential reproductive health products whenever s/he needs them.
Reproductive health commodity security exists
when every person is able to choose, obtain, and use

### There are Four Logistics pillars;-

Please take note of this;-
The Four Logistics Pillars include s, but not restricted to;-

1). FORECAST…accurately estimate commodity
requirements

2). FINANCE…obtain or organize adequate financial
resources

3). PROCURE…conduct timely and efficient acquisition of
products

4). DELIVER…ensure reliable distribution to customers
[11/7, 8:24 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯why is Logistic management important? What is the purpose of logistic management in health/pharmaceutical care?

Let's see,

The PURPOSE of a logistics system is to get the
1). RIGHT QUANTITIES of the

2). RIGHT GOODS to the

3).RIGHT PLACES at the

4).RIGHT TIME in the

5). RIGHT CONDITION at the

6). RIGHT COST.

#take note
[11/7, 8:24 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯in logistic and supply chain, management there is a pipeline of transfer & transportation of goods and services, just like pipeline for oil transportation,so let's take a cursory look at them;-

First of all, what is a Pipeline?

💯Pipeline is the entire chain of physical storage facilities and transportation links throughwhich
supplies move from the manufacturer to the user, including the port facilities, central
warehouse,regional warehouses,district warehouses, all SDP, and transport vehicles, including community-based distribution
networks.
[11/7, 8:28 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯Okay

Let's talk about "Lead Time" briefly

#What is Lead Time?

• Lead time is the time interval between when
"new stock is ordered" and "when it is received"
and available for use.

In simple terms, it simply means the time You order that phone From jumia, and the time it will be available for Your use, so you unbox it on your YouTube channel😆😆😆
[11/7, 8:36 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: In Logistic, there is something called the push and pull systems of supply;-

💯PUSH System  
(Allocation) means;-
Quantities of goods to be
issued are
determined by
personnel who
issue the supplies.
For instance, if PharmahubNG wants drugs From Roche pharmaceuticals, after sending in my inventory list, Roche will reach out to me and say, sorry oh, we can't give 100 packs of labetalol, for now we only have 50, so thats push system of supply.

💯Pull system (allocation);-
Quantities to be issued are determined by
personnel who receive the supplies.

E.g ,if PharmahubNG wants 20 packs of Tothema from Innotech pharmaceuticals, if that 20 packs is not complete, we won't make payment to the company. that's what pull systems means😁😄😁
.hope una understand
[11/7, 8:46 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯 Requisition;-

Requisition means to Possess, supply, offer to supply or administer the drugs prescribed.

It has an advantage and disadvantage,

Those in hospital setting understands this so well.

Let's take a Look;-

Requisition Advantages/
Disadvantages;-

⚡Advantage: Requisition systems are decentralized

⚡Disadvantage: They require trained staff at the lower
levels- training more people, time consuming and costs
money.

⚡Advantage: They place lower burden on upper level staff.

⚡Disadvantage: -They require service providers to spend more
time doing commodity management and filling out forms

- less time to serve clients.
  [11/7, 8:50 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯There is something called Allocation too in supply chain;-

🚬Allocation (the point where supply meets demand) is one of the most important pieces of the supply chain. So many critical business processes— customer service, inventory, sales — start is hinged on smart allocation.

It has an Advantage and Also a Disadvantage in logistic;-..

Allocation;-

💯Advantage: Allocation systems require fewer
trained staff.

🚬Disadvantage: BUT it then increases the workload of staff at the upper level (which is determining issue quantities for many facilities).
[11/7, 8:57 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯Lastly to round up this class tonight, let me draw an attention to a very important thing in logistic, it is "Data management"

Known as;-
💯Dispensed –to-user VS Issues Data;-

Information about the quantity of goods actually put in the hands of clients.
(Often shortened to
“dispensed data.”)

💯Information about the quantity of goods shipped from one level of the system to another.(often known as Issued data)

Summarily;- it means for instance
A client came to buy 10 packs of Clomid from your store, so you packed them and gave it to the client, that process is known as Dispensed to user,bcus you have not issued a receipt for the purchase,so, until you give a receipt and the goods together, and it is recorded in your ledger before it will become both "dispensed and issued Data"..

I think we understand🙌🏻🙌🏻
[11/7, 9:01 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯so that will be all for the night, we will continue on Tuesday, for now it will be spaced class, that is why we are starting early...

Expect some questions From this part, by Tomorrow🙌🏻
[11/11, 7:06 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: #LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
(LMIS);-

A logistics management information system is a subset of organizations total information systems. It involves records and reports used to gather, analyze, and validate data from all levels of the logistics system that can be used to make logistics decisions and manage the supply chain.
[11/11, 7:07 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯The Purpose of LMIS#

• The purpose of LMIS is to collect,
organize and present logistics data
gathered across all levels of the
system in order to make informed
decision
[11/11, 7:09 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯Essential Data Items;-

#STOCK ON HAND:
Quantities of usable stock available at any level or at all levels of the system at a point in time.

#RATE OF CONSUMPTION:
The average quantity of commodities dispensed to users during a particular time period.

#LOSSES/ADJUSTMENTS:
Losses are the quantity of health commodities removed from the distributionsystem (e.g., losses, expiry, damage) Adjustments are receipt or issue of supplies to/from one facility to another at the same level
(e.g., a transfer) or a correction for an error in counting
[11/11, 7:12 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯Activities that happen to supplies;-

-Stored in Inventory.

-Moved between facilities.

-Dispensed-to-user/used
[11/11, 7:14 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯Types of Records;-

-Stockkeeping records.
-Transaction records.
-Consumption records.
[11/11, 7:16 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: #💯Records:  
Records - forms
on which data are
collected and
remain at the
facility where
they are recorded.

#💯Reports;- forms on which data are moved
from one level in a
logistics system to
another.
[11/11, 7:18 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: #💯Stockkeeping Records;-

Used to record information about products in storage.

Examples:
-Bin Card (BN)
-Inventory Control Card (ICC)
[11/11, 7:22 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: #💯Stockkeeping Records Summary Points:-

Stockkeeping records are two kinds:

-Bin cards - one bin card kept per lot, batch or
expiry date; and kept with the products on the
storeroom shelves/pallets,
-Inventory control cards, generally have one per
commodity, kept in ledger or book form, and kept in the product manager ’ s office.

[11/11, 7:24 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: #💯Transaction Records:-

Used to record information about the movement of stock from one storage
facility to another. They are proof of
requisition, issue and/or delivery
Examples:
-Record for Transferring/Returning.
-Commodities
CRRIRF
-Requisition and Issue Vouchers.
[11/11, 7:25 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯#Consumption Records:-

Use to record quantity of each product used
by or dispensed to end users or used at an SDP when services are provided
Examples:
-Daily Activity -Registers
-Logs/tally/tick sheets
-Treatment/Dispensing -register
[11/11, 7:27 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯Examples of Consumption records used
in LMHC in Nigeria:-

-ARV Drugs Daily Consumption -Record
-Daily Usage -Record for HIV -Test Kits
-OI Drugs Daily Consumption Record
-Bin Card – for laboratory
[11/11, 7:31 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: #💯The Six Right for LMIS:

-The right data,
-In the Right quantity
-In the Right quality
-At the right time,
to the right place
For the right cost

#A well-functioning logistics system needs:-

-Essential Data Items
-Having all essential data from
all heath facilities
Complete and accurate data
In time to take action ,
-Place where decisions are made
Should not spend more to collect data than we spend on supplies.

[11/20, 6:44 AM] PharmahubNG▫️: 3rd Class:-

Introduction to Max-Min Inventory Control System In Supply Chain Management:-

#Purpose of an Inventory Control System:

-To determine when stock should be ordered/issued
-To determine how much stock should
be ordered/issued
-To maintain an appropriate stock level of all products, avoiding shortages and oversupply.

#Three Max-Min Inventory Control

4.  Control System
    [11/20, 6:44 AM] PharmahubNG▫️: #Storekeeper Decision Rule
    (Forced Ordering Version)

Review all stock levels at the end of each Review Period.
Order enough stock
to bring stock levels up to Max.
Storekeeper Decision Rule
(Forced Ordering Version)
For example:
Review all stock levels at the end of each quarter. Order enough stock to bring the stock levels up to 6 months.

💯Definition of Review Period:
The Review Period is the time schedule for
reviewing stock levels It is also time for ordering commodities, so in
example both the review period and the order interval is quarterly
[11/20, 6:45 AM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯Definition of Emergency Order Point:

Emergency Order Point the stock level at which an emergency order should be placed
to avoid a stock out whether the end of the Review Period has been reached EOP in Nigeria = 2 weeks (0.5 months)

#Please take note#
[11/20, 6:47 AM] PharmahubNG▫️: 💯#Storekeeper Decision Rule
(Forced Ordering Version with Emergency Order Point):-

Review all stock levels at the end of each Review
Period. Order enough stock to bring stock levels up to Max.

If the stock level for any item falls below the Emergency Order Point before the end of the Review Period, place an emergency order.
For example: 
Review all stock levels at the end of each quarter. Order enough stock to bring
the stock levels up to 6 months. 
If the stock level for any item falls below 1 month at any time, place an
emergency order.

#Take note#
[11/20, 6:49 AM] PharmahubNG▫️: #⚡Formula for How Much to Order:-

## Max stock quantity – Stock on hand = order/issue quantity

MSQ – SOH = QTO/I

---

Max stock quantity = average monthly consumption x max
stock level

Average monthly consumption = average of the quantities of product dispensed to users or patients in the most recent three months, as appropriate

## ⚡Steps in Setting Max-Min Levels:-

-Determine your Lead Time

-Set the Review Period

-Set the Safety Stock

-Set the Minimum Stock Level

-Set the Maximum Stock Level

-Set the Emergency Order Point.

## Storage of Pharmaceutical commodities,

## Key storage activities:-

- Supply receiving and incoming inspection.

- Put away.

- Picking and packing.

- Shipping.

##Take note of This
[11/25, 5:06 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 🔐Purpose of Storage( why so we store things?)

1. To Protect the quality of the
   product and its packaging
   throughout the supply chain.

2. To Make product available for
   distribution.
   [11/25, 5:07 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 🗝️ what is Shelf Life of a drug or products?

Shelf Life:
• Shelf life is the length of time a product may be stored without affecting the
usability, safety, purity, or potency of the item, assuming that the recommended
storage conditions are met.

##Take note !
[11/25, 5:12 PM] PharmahubNG▫️: 🔐General Guidelines for Health
Commodities Storage :-

-Clean and disinfect storeroom regularly.

-Store supplies in a dry, well-lit, and well-ventilated storeroom, out of direct sunlight.

-Secure the storeroom from water penetration.
Ensure that fire safety equipment is available and accessible, and that personnel are trained to use it.
-Maintain cold storage, including a cold chain, for
commodities that require it.
-Store condoms and other latex products away
from electric motors and fluorescent lights.
-Keep narcotics and other controlled substances in a locked place.
-Store flammable products separately using
appropriate safety precautions.
-Stack cartons at least 10 cm (4 in) off the floor,
30 cm (1 ft) away from the walls and other stacks, and no more than 2.5 m (8 ft) high.

-Store medical supplies separately, away from insecticides,
chemicals, old files, office supplies, and other materials.
-Arrange cartons so that arrows point up, and ensure that
identification labels, expiry dates, and manufacturing
dates are visible.
-Store supplies in a manner accessible for FEFO, counting,
and general management.
-Separate and dispose of damaged or expired products
without delay.
