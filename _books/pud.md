# Pharmacotherapy of PUD

peptic ulcer is an open sore or raw area in the lining of the stomach or intestine.

There are two types of peptic ulcers:

▫️Gastric ulcer -- occurs in the stomach

▫️Duodenal ulcer -- occurs in the first part of the small intestine

✨Aetiology/ Cause:

Normally, the lining of the stomach and small intestines can protect itself against strong stomach acids. But if the lining breaks down, the result may be:

Swollen and inflamed tissue (gastritis)

An ulcer

Most ulcers occur in the first layer of the inner lining. A hole in the stomach or duodenum is called a perforation. This is a medical emergency.

The most common cause of ulcers is infection of the stomach by bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). Most people with peptic ulcers have these bacteria living in their digestive tract. Yet, many people who have these bacteria in their stomach do not develop an ulcer.

The following factors raise your risk for peptic ulcers:

Drinking too much alcohol

Regular use of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Smoking cigarettes or chewing tobacco

Being very ill, such as being on a breathing machine

Radiation treatments

Stress

A rare condition, called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, causes stomach and duodenal ulcers

✨Symptoms

Small ulcers may not cause any symptoms. Some ulcers can cause serious bleeding.

Abdominal pain (often in the upper mid-abdomen) is a common symptom. The pain can differ from person to person. Some people have no pain.

Pain occurs:

In the upper abdomen

At night and wakes you up

When you feel an empty stomach, often 1 to 3 hours after a meal

Other symptoms include:

Feeling of fullness and problems drinking as much fluid as usual

Nausea

Vomiting

Bloody or dark, tarry stools

Chest pain

Fatigue

Vomiting, possibly bloody

Weight loss

Ongoing heartburn

✨ Diagnosis & Tests:

To detect an ulcer, you may need a test called an upper endoscopy (EGD).

This is a test to check the lining of the food pipe, stomach, and first part of the small intestine.

It is done with a small camera (flexible endoscope) that is inserted down the throat.

This test most often requires sedation given through a vein.

In some cases, a smaller endoscope may be used that is passed into the stomach through the nose. This does not require sedation.

EGD is done on most people when peptic ulcers are suspected or when you have:

Low blood count (anemia)

Trouble swallowing

Bloody vomit

Bloody or dark and tarry-looking stools

Lost weight without trying

Other findings that raise a concern for cancer in the stomach

Testing for H pylori is also needed. This may be done by biopsy of the stomach during endoscopy, with a stool test, or by a urea breath test.

Other tests you may have include:

Hemoglobin blood test to check for anemia

Stool occult blood test to test for blood in your stool

Sometimes, you may need a test called an upper GI series. A series of x-rays are taken after you drink a thick substance called barium. This does not require sedation.

A peptic ulcer is an open sore or raw area in the lining of the stomach or intestine.

There are two types of peptic ulcers:

Gastric ulcer -- occurs in the stomach

Duodenal ulcer -- occurs in the first part of the small intestine

￼

A peptic ulcer is an open sore or raw area in the lining of the stomach (gastric) or the upper part of the small intestine (duodenal).

￼

A major cause of peptic ulcer, although far less common than H.pylori or NSAIDS, is Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A large amount of excess acid is produced in response to the overproduction of the hormone gastrin, which in turn is caused by tumors on the pancreas or duodenum. These tumors are usually malignant, must be removed and acid production suppressed to relieve the recurrence of the ulcers.

￼

An ulcer is a crater-like lesion on the skin or mucous membrane caused by an inflammatory, infectious, or malignant condition. To avoid irritating an ulcer a person can try eliminating certain substances from their diet such as caffeine, alcohol, aspirin, and avoid smoking. Patients can take certain medicines to suppress the acid in the stomach causing the the erosion of the stomach lining. Endoscopic therapy can be used to stop bleeding from the ulcer.

￼

Peptic ulcers may lead to emergency situations. Severe abdominal pain with or without evidence of bleeding may indicate a perforation of the ulcer through the stomach or duodenum. Vomiting of a substance that resembles coffee grounds, or the presence of black tarry stools, may indicate serious bleeding.

￼

The procedure called gastroscopy involves the placing of an endoscope (a small flexible tube with a camera and light) into the stomach and duodenum to search for abnormalities. Tissue samples may be obtained to check for H pylori bacteria, a cause of many peptic ulcers. An actively bleeding ulcer may also be cauterized (blood vessels are sealed with a burning tool) during a gastroscopy procedure.

A peptic ulcer is an open sore or raw area in the lining of the stomach (gastric) or the upper part of the small intestine (duodenal).

If you've got stomach pain and nausea, any number of gastrointestinal problems could be to blame. When these symptoms don't go away, one possibility is that you have a peptic ulcer. Let's talk about peptic ulcers. A peptic ulcer is a defect in the lining of your stomach or the first part of your small intestine, the duodenum. When the defect is in your stomach, it's called a gastric ulcer. A defect in your duodenum is called a duodenal ulcer. Your stomach is filled with strong acid, which breaks down and digests the foods you eat. If you've ever seen a strong acid at work, you know that it starts to burn away anything it touches. That's why your stomach and intestines are equipped with a special lining to protect them. But if that lining breaks down for any reason, acids can start eating their way through. When acids burn a hole all the way through the stomach or duodenum, it's called a perforation, and that's a medical emergency. You may joke that your boss is giving you an ulcer, and it's possible that stress does play some part in ulcers. More likely, your ulcer is caused by a stomach infection with a type of bacteria called H. pylori. Other common ulcer risks include smoking cigarettes, drinking a lot of alcohol, or regularly using NSAID pain relievers like aspirin and ibuprofen. If the ulcer is small, you may have no idea that you have it because there are no symptoms. Larger ulcers can cause abdominal pain, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, and nausea. If you have any of these ongoing symptoms, your doctor will look inside your GI tract to see what's going on. One way to do this is with an upper endoscopy, a thin tube with a camera on one end that takes pictures as it moves through your stomach and small intestine. A lower GI is a series of x-rays that are taken after you drink a radioactive substance called barium. Your doctor will also test you for the H. pylori bacteria that may be causing your ulcer. Treatment for peptic ulcers works in two ways. If you have an H. pylori infection, you'll have a medication regimen to kill the bacteria. You'll also get a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor, such as Prilosec or Prevacid, which reduces the amount of acid in your stomach. Try to avoid taking NSAID pain relievers for long periods of time, especially if you have a problem with H. pylori. Use Tylenol instead. If you do have to take NSAIDs, also take an acid-blocking drug to protect your sensitive stomach. Also avoid tobacco smile and excess alcohol. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully for treating a peptic ulcer. If you don't follow your treatment as directed, your ulcer could come back. Call your doctor right away if you have sharp stomach pain, you're sweating a lot or feeling confused, or your stomach feels hard to the touch. These could be signs of a serious ulcer complication that needs immediate medical help.

Causes

Normally, the lining of the stomach and small intestines can protect itself against strong stomach acids. But if the lining breaks down, the result may be:

Swollen and inflamed tissue (gastritis)

An ulcer

Most ulcers occur in the first layer of the inner lining. A hole in the stomach or duodenum is called a perforation. This is a medical emergency.

The most common cause of ulcers is infection of the stomach by bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). Most people with peptic ulcers have these bacteria living in their digestive tract. Yet, many people who have these bacteria in their stomach do not develop an ulcer.

The following factors raise your risk for peptic ulcers:

Exams and Tests

To detect an ulcer, you may need a test called an upper endoscopy (EGD).

This is a test to check the lining of the food pipe, stomach, and first part of the small intestine.

It is done with a small camera (flexible endoscope) that is inserted down the throat.

This test most often requires sedation given through a vein.

In some cases, a smaller endoscope may be used that is passed into the stomach through the nose. This does not require sedation.

EGD is done on most people when peptic ulcers are suspected or when you have:

Low blood count (anemia)

Testing for H pylori is also needed. This may be done by biopsy of the stomach during endoscopy, with a stool test, or by a urea breath test.

Other tests you may have include:

Hemoglobin blood test to check for anemia

Stool occult blood test to test for blood in your stool

Sometimes, you may need a test called an upper GI series. A series of x-rays are taken after you drink a thick substance called barium. This does not require sedation.

Treatment

Your health care provider will recommend medicines to heal your ulcer and prevent a relapse. The medicines will:

Kill the H pylori bacteria, if present.

Reduce acid levels in the stomach. These include H2 blockers such as ranitidine (Zantac), or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as pantoprozole.

Take all of your medicines as you have been told. Other changes in your lifestyle can also help.

If you have a peptic ulcer with an H pylori infection, the standard treatment uses different combinations of the following medicines for 7 to 14 days:

Two different antibiotics to kill H pylori.

PPIs such as omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), or esomeprazole (Nexium).

Bismuth (the main ingredient in Pepto-Bismol) may be added to help kill the bacteria.

You will likely need to take a PPI for 8 weeks if:

You have an ulcer without an H pylori infection.

Your ulcer is caused by taking aspirin or NSAIDs.

Your provider may also prescribe this type of medicine regularly if you continue taking aspirin or NSAIDs for other health conditions.

Other medicines used for ulcers are:

Misoprostol, a medicine that may help prevent ulcers in people who take NSAIDs on a regular basis

Medicines that protect the tissue lining, such as sucralfate

If a peptic ulcer bleeds a lot, an EGD may be needed to stop the bleeding. Methods used to stop the bleeding include:

Injecting medicine in the ulcer

Applying metal clips or heat therapy to the ulcer

Surgery may be needed if:

Bleeding cannot be stopped with an EGD

The ulcer has caused a tear

✨ Complications

Complications may include:

▪️Severe blood loss

▪️Scarring from an ulcer may make it harder for the stomach to empty

▪️Perforation or hole of the stomach and intestines

✨Prevention:

Avoid aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and other NSAIDs. Try acetaminophen instead. If you must take such medicines, talk to your provider first. Your provider may:

▪️Test you for H pylori before you take these medicines

▪️Ask you to take PPIs or an H2 acid blocker

▪️Prescribe a medicine called misoprostol

The following lifestyle changes may help prevent peptic ulcers:

▪️DO NOT smoke or chew tobacco.

▪️Avoid alcohol.
