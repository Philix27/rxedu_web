# 💥PHARMACOTHERAPY OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:

Myocardial infarction (MI) or “heart attack,” is caused by decreased or complete cessation of blood flow to a portion of the myocardium.

Myocardial infarction

May be “silent” and go undetected, or it could be a catastrophic event leading to hemodynamic deterioration and sudden death.

Mainly due to underlying coronary artery disease. When the coronary artery is occluded, the myocardium is deprived of oxygen. Prolonged deprivation of oxygen supply to the myocardium can lead to myocardial cell death and necrosis.

May be associated with ECG changes and elevated biochemical markers such as cardiac troponins

Patients can present with chest discomfort or pressure that can radiate to the neck, jaw, shoulder, or arm.

[05/01, 7:28 pm] PharmahubNG▫️: ✒️ETIOLOGY/CAUSES:-

Myocardial infarction is closely associated with coronary artery disease, and the risk factors for MI are similarly associated with the below:

Smoking

Abnormal lipid profile/blood apolipoprotein (raised ApoB/ApoA1)

Hypertension

Diabetes mellitus

Abdominal obesity (waist/hip ratio) (greater than 0.90 for males and greater than 0.85 for females)

Psychosocial factors such as depression, loss of the locus of control, global stress, financial stress, and life events including marital separation, job loss, and family conflicts

Lack of daily consumption of fruits or vegetables

Lack of physical activity

Some non-modifiable risk factors for myocardial infarction include:

Advanced age

Male gender (males tend to have myocardial infarction earlier in life)

Genetics (there is an increased risk of MI if a first-degree relative has a history of cardiovascular events before the age of 50). The role of genetic loci that increase the risk for MI is under active investigation
[05/01, 7:30 pm] PharmahubNG▫️: ✒️EPIDEMIOLOGY:

The most common cause of death and disability in the western world and worldwide is coronary artery disease

There are 32.4 million myocardial infarctions and strokes worldwide every year.

Patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) are the highest risk group for further coronary events.

Survivors of MI are at increased risk of recurrent infarctions and have an annual death rate of 5% - six times that in people of the same age who do not have coronary heart disease.

Myocardial Infarctions are the leading cause of death in the industrialized nations of the world. In the United States, there are about 450,000 deaths due to MIs each year. Now 95% of patients hospitalized with an MI will survive due to improvements in emergency response time, and treatment techniques. The risk of having an MI increases with age, but 50% of MIs in the United States occur in people under the age of 65 years old.
[05/01, 7:31 pm] PharmahubNG▫️: ✒️ SYMPTOMS:

Myocardial ischemia can present as:-

Chest pain, upper extremity pain, mandibular, or epigastric discomfort that occurs during exertion or at rest and is usually not affected by positional changes or active movement of the region. Chest pain (usually retrosternal), sometimes described as the sensation of pressure or heaviness.

Pain radiating to the left shoulder, neck, or arms (with no obvious precipitating factors), and it may be intermittent or persistent.

Dyspnea or fatigue.

Pain lasting more than 20 minutes

Additional symptoms, such as sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and syncope, may also be present.

Atypical with subtle findings such as palpitations

Dramatic manifestations, such as cardiac arrest.

Silent ie with no symptoms.

Signs and symptoms vary based on gender.

The most common symptom experienced by both genders is chest pain or discomfort.

Women typically experience other symptoms such as SOA, nausea and vomiting, and neck or jaw pain.
[05/01, 7:32 pm] PharmahubNG▫️: ✒️TREATMENT & DIAGNOSIS:-

The diagnosis and management of patients with MI is best done with an interprofessional team. In most hospitals, there are cardiology teams that are dedicated to the management of these patients.

For patients who present with chest pain, the key to the management of MI is time to treatment.

.A cardiology consult should be made immediately to ensure that the patient gets treated within the time frame recommendations.

.As MI can be associated with several serious complications, these patients are best managed in an ICU setting.

Long term management:

There is no cure for ischemic heart disease, and all treatments are symptom-oriented.

.The key to improving outcomes is to prevent coronary artery disease.

.The primary care provider, physiotherapist and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the benefits of a healthy diet, the importance of controlling blood pressure and diabetes, exercising regularly, discontinuing smoking, maintaining healthy body weight, and remaining compliant with medications.

.The pharmacist should educate the patient on types of medication used to treat ischemic heart disease, their benefits, and potential adverse effects.
