# PUBLIC HEALTH PHARMACY COMPETENCE

Concept & Determinants of health:

-take note of the types of concept and their relative implications to health care.

The determinants of health:

_Introduction_
Many factors combine together to affect the health of individuals and communities. Whether people are healthy or not, is determined by their circumstances and environment. To a large extent, factors such as where we live, the state of our environment, genetics, our income and education level, and our relationships with friends and family all have considerable impacts on health, whereas the more commonly considered factors such as access and use of health care services often have less of an impact.

_The determinants of health include:_
the social and economic environment,
the physical environment, and
the person’s individual characteristics and behaviours.
The context of people’s lives determine their health, and so blaming individuals for having poor health or crediting them for good health is inappropriate. Individuals are unlikely to be able to directly control many of the determinants of health. These determinants—or things that make people healthy or not—include the above factors, and many others:

Income and social status - higher income and social status are linked to better health. The greater the gap between the richest and poorest people, the greater the differences in health.
Education – low education levels are linked with poor health, more stress and lower self-confidence.
Physical environment – safe water and clean air, healthy workplaces, safe houses, communities and roads all contribute to good health. Employment and working conditions – people in employment are healthier, particularly those who have more control over their working conditions
Social support networks – greater support from families, friends and communities is linked to better health. Culture - customs and traditions, and the beliefs of the family and community all affect health.
Genetics - inheritance plays a part in determining lifespan, healthiness and the likelihood of developing certain illnesses. Personal behaviour and coping skills – balanced eating, keeping active, smoking, drinking, and how we deal with life’s stresses and challenges all affect health.
Health services - access and use of services that prevent and treat disease influences health
Gender - Men and women suffer from different types of diseases at different ages.

_INTRODUCTION_

Determinants of health are a range of factors that influence the health status of individuals or populations. At every stage of life, health is determined by complex interactions between social and economic factors, the physical environment and individual behaviour. They do not exist in isolation from each other.

determinants of health includes :

Income and social status

Social support networks

Education and literacy

Employment/working conditions

Social environments

Physical environments

Personal health practices and coping skills

Healthy child development

Biology and genetic endowment

Health services

Gender

Culture

_HEALTH DETERMINANT CONTEXTS_
.
The context of people’s lives determine their health, and so blaming individuals for having poor health or crediting them for good health is inappropriate. Individuals are unlikely to be able to directly control many of the determinants of health. These determinants—or things that make people healthy or not—include the above factors, and many others:

Income and social status - higher income and social status are linked to better health. The greater the gap between the richest and poorest people, the greater the differences in health.
Education – low education levels are linked with poor health, more stress and lower self-confidence.

Physical environment – safe water and clean air, healthy workplaces, safe houses, communities and roads all contribute to good health..

Employment and working conditions – people in employment are healthier, particularly those who have more control over their working conditions

Social support networks – gre

ater support from families, friends and communities is linked to better health.

Culture - customs and traditions, and the beliefs of the family and community all affect health.

Genetics - inheritance plays a part in determining lifespan, healthiness and the likelihood of developing certain illnesses. Personal behaviour and coping skills – balanced eating, keeping active, smoking, drinking, and how we deal with life’s stresses and challenges all affect health.

Health services - access and use of services that prevent and treat disease influences health

Gender - Men and women suffer from different types of diseases at different ages.

_EVIDENCE BASE OF HEALTH DETERMINANTS!_

An evidence base about the impact that projects, programmes and policies have had on health is required to carry out HIA. The best available evidence is used within the appraisal stage of HIA to determine what impacts may occur (both positive and negative), the size of the impact (if possible) and the distribution of that impact in different population groups. It is generally assumed that the evidence for health impacts exists, and that searching and collating will provide the necessary evidence. Unfortunately this is not often the case, and the evidence of health impacts is often not available. This is because of the long causal pathway between the implementation of a project/programme/policy and any potential impact on population health, and the many confounding factors that make the determination of a link difficult. Within the HIA it is important therefore to be explicit about sources of evidence and to identify missing or incomplete information.

Providing a comprehensive review of the evidence base is not simple. It needs to draw on the best available evidence – that from reviews and research papers, and including qualitative and quantitative evidence. This information must be supplemented with local and expert knowledge, policy information, and proposal specific information.

However, there are examples where the best available evidence has been documented, and in some cases summarised. These are presented below:

Transport
Food and Agriculture
Housing
Waste
Energy
Industry
Urbanization
Water
Radiation
Nutrition and health

Transport

Evidence of health impact focus on:

Accidents between motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians (particularly children and young people).

Pollution from burning fossil fuels such as particulates and ozone.

Noise from transportation.

Psychosocial effects such as severance of communities by large roads and the restriction of children’s movement.

Climate change due to CO2 emission

Loss of land

Improved physical activity from cycling or walking

Increased access to employment, shops and support services

Recreational uses of road spaces

Contributes to economic development

Vector borne diseases

_Food and Agriculture_

Tobacco farming and its impact on heart disease, stroke, certain cancers and chronic respiratory disease. Including passive smoking and impact of foetal development. Pesticide policies on tobacco crops require consideration.
Changes in land use, soil quality, choice of crop, use of agricultural labour and occupational health.
Mechanisation of work previously done by hand, and plantation agriculture.
Fisheries – biotoxins, pollution, chemical use, wastewater, processing, and occupational health
Forestry – vector borne diseases, occupational health, and food security.
Livestock use – vector borne diseases, drug residues, animal feed, waste, and food security.
Sustainable farming including chemical and energy use, biodiversity, organic production methods, and diversity of foods produced.
Fertiliser use – nitrate levels in food, pollution of waterways, re-use of agricultural waste.

Water – irrigation use and its impact on river/water-table levels and production outputs.
Pesticide usage and veterinary drugs– legal requirements, best practice, consumer issues.
Food packaging, preservation and safety, and avoidance of long storage and travel.
Access to, and distribution of food
Household food secur

ity – appropriate food being available, with adequate access and being affordable (location of markets, supermarkets and closure of small suppliers creating food deserts in cities).
Food supplies, including national and regional food security, and regional production.
National food security – able to provide adequate nutrition within a country without relying heavily on imported products
Cold-chain reliability – the safety of transporting products that deteriorate microbiologically in the heat.
Dietary patterns, diversity of food available and home production, particularly:
Fruit and vegetable consumption on reduced stroke, heart disease and risk of certain cancers,
Total, saturated and polyunsaturated fat, carbohydrates and sugars consumption on obesity, heart disease, stroke and other vascular diseases.
Alcohol consumption and impact on social effects related to behaviour (traffic accidents, work/home accidents, violence, social relations, unwanted pregnancy and STDs), and toxic effects (all-cause mortality, alcoholism, certain cancers, liver cirrhosis, psychosis, poisoning, gastritis, stroke, foetal alcohol syndrome and others).
Micronutrients such as iron, vitamin A, zinc and iodine and their impact on deficiency syndromes.
Food safety and foodborne illness hazzards
Food and water are the major sources of exposure to both chemical and biological hazzards. They impose a substantial health risk to consumers and economic burdens on individuals, communities and nations.

Microorganisms such as salmonella, campylobacter, E. coli O157, listeria, cholera.
Viruses such as hepatitis A, and parasites such as trichomonosis in pigs and cattle.
Naturally occuring toxins such as mycotoxins, marine biotoxins and glycosides.
Unconventional agents such as the agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or "mad cow disease"),
Persistant organic pollutants such as dioxins and PCBs. Metals such as lead and mercury.
New foods developed from biotechnology such as crops modified to resist pests, changes in animal husbandry, antibiotic use and new food additives

Housing

Evidence of health impacts focus on:

Improvements in housing and improved mental health and general health

The possibility of improved housing leading to rent rises, impacting negatively on health.

Movement of original tenants after housing improvement and therefore not benefiting from the improvements.

Housing tenure, outdoor temperature, indoor air quality, dampness, housing design, rent subsidies, relocation, allergens and dust mites, home accident prevention, and fire prevention.

Homelessness.

Waste

Evidence of health impacts focuses on environmental and social determinants related to:

the transmission of agents of infectious disease from human and animal excreta (sanitation, hygiene and water-related);

exposure to toxic chemicals in human and animal excreta; and in industrial wastes discharged into the environment;

environmental degradation, direct and indirect impacts on health;

exposure to radioactive wastes;

exposure to health-care wastes;

exposure to solid wastes and involvement in informal waste recycling; and

breeding of disease vectors.

[8/29, 5:17 AM] PharmaHub: PHARMACOVIGILANCE REVISION:

Pharmacovigilance is the science relating to
the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring and prevention of adverse effect
with pharmaceutical product.

GOALS OF PHARMACOVIGILANCE:

√To Assess and communicate risk and benefits of drugs in the market.

√To promote rational and safe use of medicine.

√To educate and inform the patient

AIM OF PHARMACOVIGILANCE
•
√To detect increase in known adverse reaction.

√To identify predisposing factors and possible
mechanism underlying adverse reaction.

√To estimate quantitative aspect of risk benefits analysis and dissemination of
information needed to improve drug prescribing, use and regulation.

LIMITATIONS.
√Reporting bias
√Poor at detecting delayed ADRs
√Deaths poorly reported
√Unable to accurately assess risk, risk
√factors or drug comparisons.

REASONS FOR
PHARMACOVIGILANCE IN NIGERIA:
•  
The information received on adverse effects of
drugs in other countries may not be relevant or
applicable to Nigeria due to various differences
that may not influence patients response
including. Diseases and prescribing practices.
√Treatment seeking behavior e.g. self medication.
√The use of traditional and complimentary drugs
e.g. herbal remedies.
√Genetics, diet, traditions of the people e.g high carbohydrate, fat, etc.

GUIDE TO REPORTING ADRs

Who should report AdverseDrug Reactions

What will happen to my Adverse Drug Reaction report
What should be reported.????

WHO SHOULD REPORT ADR???????

All health care professionals including :
Physicians
Pharmacists
Nurses
Dentist
Manufacturers
Patient
General public

WHAT SHOULD BE REPORTED :
•
√Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction

√Unexpected lack of efficacy such as resistance, interactions, counterfeiting
√Dependence & Abuse
√Medication Errors
√Poisoning

ROLES OF PHARMACIST
•
Pharmacists contribute to the drug safety by
preventing,identifying,documenting and reporting
ADRs.
√Pharmacist plays a vital role in medication safety monitoring
.
√Pharmacist plays an essential role in developing communication materials like newsletter and
other publications through the drug information
and poison centres, which are utilized by different
professions and professionals for disseminating
drug alert and other drug safety information

√Pharmacist must also be involved in
collection of data that might be useful in triggering the initiation of longitudinal pharmaco epidemiological studies.

√Pharmacists' can assure a positive
environment to the patient in minimizing the medication errors, improve patient safety and quality of life during counseling session.

√Pharmacist act as an open-arm top clinical
expertise in sharing of resources including
databases.

√Apart from reporting of ADRs, pharmacists
can also pre-occupy themselves in keeping
track of important files and documents related to patient safety in maximizing the
benefit and minimizing the risk of medication use.

√Pharmacist should have a firm knowledge in monitoring and providing counselling about the use of over-the-counter medications.

Conclusion!!!!

Research in pharmacovigilance will strengthen the clinical pharmacist’s role in
more clinically valued output. Educational programs and workshops can clarify and enhance the knowledge of ADRs reporting
and how causality assessment of ADRs is done. This will enable the pharmacist to
play prominent role in reporting ADRs and patient safety in the future.
