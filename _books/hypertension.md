# HYPERTENSION SUMMARY:

### **INTRODUCTION**

Hypertension(HTN) also known as high blood pressure(HBP) is the most common
cardiovascular disease.
The African region has the highest prevalence of HTN estimated at 46% of
adults aged 25 and above.

A meta-analysis study put the overall HTN
prevalence in Nigeria at 28.9%, men-29.5%,
women-25%, urban dwellers-30.6%, rural
dwellers-26.4%

Sustained HTN damages blood vessels in the kidney, heart, brain and eye leading to increased incidence of renal failure, coronary disease, heart failure, stroke, dementia and blindness.
Adequate control of blood pressure has been shown to prevent damage to blood vessels and substantially reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

### **DEFINITION**

HTN is defined as repeatedly elevated
blood pressure (BP) ≥140/90mmHg

- Normal blood pressure : ˂120/80mmHg
- Prehypertension : 120-139/80-89mmHg
- Stage 1 HTN : 140-159/90-99mmHg
- Stage 2 HTN : ≥160/100mmHg

The risk of organ damage is directly related to extent of blood pressure elevation Starting from 115/75mmHg, cardiovascular disease risk doubles with each increment of
20/10mmHg throughout the BP range Most important and common complications
are stroke and myocardial infarction

An increase in 5mmHg in usual diastolic BP is associated with 35-40% increased risk of stroke. Risk of heart failure is increased 6x in hypertensive patients Diagnosis of HTN depends on the measurement of BP and not on patient’s symptoms HTN is usually asymptomatic until organ damage is imminent or has already occurred

### **RISK FACTORS**

- Non-modifiable – age, male gender, black race, family history

- Modifiable physiological – increased LDL, decreased HDL, diabetes

- Behavioural – stress (overactive sympathetic nervous system), sedentary lifestyle, obesity ( greater perfusion demands of increased body mass)

### **TYPES OF HTN**

1. **Primary or Essential HTN:**
   HTN with no specific cause
   Occurs in about 90-95% of cases Epidemiologic evidence points to combination of factors (genetic, psychological stress, environmental and dietary factors-increased salt
   and decreased potassium & calcium intake)

2. **Secondary HTN:**
   HTN with a specific cause (eg,coarctation of the
   aorta, pheochromocytoma, cushing’s disease, drugs, food) Occurs in about 5-10% of cases

### **TREATMENT OF HTN**

Goals of treatment:

1. Reduction of blood pressure
2. Control of risk factors
3. Prevention of complications
4. Reversal of target organ disease Improvement of quality of life by the use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological means.

### **NON-PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT (LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION)**

1. SMOKING
   a strong independent risk factor for CVD,Smoking causes an immediate increase in blood pressure and heart rate that persists for more than 15 minutes after one cigarette Smoking cessation markedly reduces overall cardiovascular risk, including the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, compared with continued smoking.

2. PHYSICAL EXERCISES:
   Physical activity lowers resting and daytime ambulatory blood pressure.
   . In clinical trials of people with hypertension, regular aerobic activity reduced systolic blood pressure by an average of 6.9 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 4.9 mmHg.8 Regular physical activity has an independent cardioprotective effect

3. WEIGHT REDUCTION
   There is a direct association between blood pressure and body weight and/or abdominal adiposity.
   Weight loss studies show that clinically significant blood pressure reductions can be achieved by modest weight loss in people with and without hypertension and that blood pressure reduction is proportional to weight
   loss.

4. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION:
   Moderate drinking can increase blood pressure, while binge drinking appears to increase the risk of hypertension
   The Heart Foundation recommends that patients
   with hypertension limit their alcohol intake to a maximum of two standard drinks per day for men, and one standard drink per day for women Note: one standard drink is considered 13.6 g or
   17.2 ml of ethanol, or approximately 44mL of 80
   proof (40%) spirits, 355 mL beer or 148 mL of
   12% wine.

5. STRESS MANAGEMENT:
   In hypertensive patients in whom stress may be contributing to blood pressure elevation, stress management should be considered as an intervention. Individualized cognitive behavioural
   interventions are more likely to be effective when relaxation techniques are employed.

### **PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT (ANTIHYPERTENSIVES)**

- BETA –ADRENOCEPTOR BLOCKERS
- ALPHA-ADRENOCEPTOR BLOCKERS
- CENTRALLY ACTING •SYMPATHOLYTIC DRUGS
- VASODILATORS
- DIRECT RENIN INHIBITORS
