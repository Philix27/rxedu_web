INTRODUCTION:

Osteoarthritis is a common chronic condition of articular cartilage degeneration. Secondary changes occur in the bone, leading to pain , decreased functioning and even disability.
It is the most common type of arthritis.
Until age 55 years, it affects men more but after age 55, women are more likely to have the disease.
[11/01, 7:02 pm] #PharmahubNG‚ñ´Ô∏è: #Rheumatoid Arthritis:

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic , systemic, autoimmune disease involves inflammation in the membrane lining of the joint, and often affect internal organs.
It occurs more in women, and peaks at age 35 to 50 years.
[11/01, 7:03 pm] #PharmahubNG‚ñ´Ô∏è: #Anatomy and physiology of a Joint:

Synovial Joint: consist of two bone ends
covered by the articular cartilage.
The articular cartilage :
Enables frictionless movement of the joint Acts as shock absorber to prevent
damage Promotes stability during use.

Cartilage: vascular , aneural; composed
primarily of water, made from
chondrocytes and extracellular matrix

Chondrocytes: They produce
proteoglycans and collagen in the extracellular matrix to maintain the integrity of the matrix in the healthy
cartilage.

The Joint Capsule: is a fibrous outer layer that encapsulates the joint. It is lined by the synovium, which produces viscous fluid that lubricates the joint.

The synovial fluid: is composed in part of hyaluronic acid.
Glucosamine is a component of hyaluronic acid. The role of hyaluronic acid is to maintain the structural and functional characteristics of
the extracellular matrix.

Bursae: are small sacs that are lined with synovial membrane and filled with fluid to provide cushioning and lubrication for the movement of the joint.
[11/01, 7:05 pm] #PharmahubNG‚ñ´Ô∏è: #Let's talk about the pathophysiology of Osteoarthritis:

#Pathophysiology of Osteoarthritis:
‚Ä¢
The strength of tendon, ligament and muscle declines with advancing age The number of chondrocytes decreases owing to apoptosis(cell death), decreased proliferation or both.

#The synthesis of normal proteoglycan is reduced
Chondrocytes lose the ability to promote healing and cartilage remodeling. Which results in?

‚úìInterleukin-1 has several roles in the development of OA
Enhances nitric oxide production and induces

‚úìchondrocytes apoptosis.
Induction of chondrocytes and synovial cells to synthesize Matrixmetalloprpteinases
(MMPs), which promotes cartilage degradation.

‚úìInhibits the synthesis of Type II collagen and proteoglycans, preventing collagen from repairing itself.
[11/01, 7:05 pm] #PharmahubNG‚ñ´Ô∏è: #Now, what are the risk Factors to Osteoarthritis?üôä

RISK FACTORS:

‚Ä¢Advanced age

‚Ä¢Female gender

‚Ä¢Muscle weakness

‚Ä¢Obesity

‚Ä¢Joint trauma

‚Ä¢Heredity

‚Ä¢Repititive stress

#How does Osteoarthritis present?

CLINICAL PRESENTATION:

‚úìIt is characterized by deep, localized ache in the joint.

‚úìPain and stiffness usually occurs with rest or immobility lasting <30mins. Inflammation might be present.

‚úìUsually affects the hips , knees, spine, feet and hands.

‚úìPhysical examination: Joint tenderness, crepitus, diminished range of motion and misshaped joints.
No specific lab test are diagnostic for OA
[11/01, 7:07 pm] #PharmahubNG‚ñ´Ô∏è: #TREATMENT:

Goals:
‚úìControl pain and other symptoms
‚úìMaintain or improve joint mobility Correct or minimize functional limitations and disability.

#Non-Pharmacological treatment:
Patient education, weight loss, aerobic exercise, acupuncture, thermal therapy.

Pharmacological treatment:

‚úìAcetaminophen is considered first line treatment.

Does it have anti-inflammatory
effects?
Max daily dose is 4g. Can cause hepatotoxicity when taken in overdose.

‚úìNSAIDS :are non-selective inhibitors of COX1
and 2 as well as thromboxane synthetase.

‚úìAnalgesia is seen in short treatment duration
and at lower doses Anti-inflammatory response is seen at higher doses and for several days
[11/01, 7:10 pm] #PharmahubNG‚ñ´Ô∏è: #Let's talk about Rheumatoid arthritis:-

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

The cause is not fully understood but it is an
autoimmune disease in which the body loses
its ability to distinguish btw synovial and foreign tissues.

Risk factors- heredity, trauma, infections,
antigen dependent activation of T lymphocytes, Tumor necrosis factor alpha,
IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, growth factor and inflamed synovium

Clinical manifestation:-malaise, anorexia, symmetrical tender and swollen joints. Pain In the joint is aggravated by movement.

Affected areas- hands, wrist,spine, shoulder, ankle, hip
Extra articular manifestation includes:
anemia, rheumatoid nodules, peripheral neuropathy, kidney disease, CV disease, pulmonary disease Marks of RA- erthrocyte sedimentation rate
and C-reactive protein, both usually elevated in a case of RA. What are their usual values?
[11/01, 7:11 pm] #PharmahubNG‚ñ´Ô∏è: #Non-pharmacological therapy: exercise, joint protection, physical therapy.

#Pharmacological therapy:

Corticosteroids (lets discuss dose used in
practise)

Methotrexate: inhibits dihydrofolate reductase.It is considered standard therapy
for RA. Cocomittant use with folic acid may
reduce side effects

‚úìLeflunomide:inhibits pyrimidine synthesis.It
has long elimination half life hence the use of cholestyramine as binding agent. Long elimination half life equals increased toxicity

‚úìSulfasalazine is cleaved by bacteria in the colon into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid

‚úìHydroxychloroquine- MOA: unknown

‚úìTNFalphablockers e.g etanercept, infliximab.
They are considered when patient does not
respond to the earlier stated

‚úìAbatacept: First T-cell costimulation
blocker
Rituximab Infliximab

‚úìAnakinra: IL1 receptor blocker
Tocilizumab: IL6 receptor for monoclonal antibody

‚úìSurgical treatment: total joint arthroplasty, joint fusion.
Let's talk about doses and A/E:
Methotrexate; 7.5-15mg PO weekly;nausea,
hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, myelosuppresion, mouth ulcers

‚úìSulphasalazine: 500mg PO b.d., gradually increase to 2-3g/day in 2-4divided doses.

A/E ...diarrhea, rash, nausea, photosensitivity
Hydoxychloroquine: 200mg-300mg PO b.d
A/E ocular toxicity, rash, nausea, myopathy
Minocycline: 100mg PO b.d A/E GI, rash
Leflunomide: 100mg/day Po√ó3days, then
10-20mg/day. A/E: diarrhea, nausea, HTN, rash,
alopecia, liver toxicity
Infliximab 3mg/kg IV over 2hrs,at wk 0, 2, 6
then every 8weeks. A/E dizziness, nausea,
abdominal pain hepatic, hematological
infections.
